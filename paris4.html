Occasional heat waves can push temperatures above 30 °C (86 °F) and rarely even reach 35 °C (95 °F). The sun is up from 06:00 until almost 22:00.</p>
<p>Spring and fall are normally cool and wet.</p>
<p>Paris (PAR  IATA) is served by two international airports.</p>
<p>49.00982.56121 Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG IATA) is the main airport of the city. It is north of Paris and is connected by train, bus and taxi. For detailed information on arriving and departing Paris from this airport please consult the main article linked above.</p>
<p>Transit Summary: The RER train line "B" connects CDG airport to central Paris and is the fastest and most economical option for most travellers. Signs in the airport will direct you to the platform. Self-serve electronic kiosks sell tickets. The kiosks provide service in multiple languages, including English. Some trains will stop at each station along the way to Paris. Express trains with fewer stops are available during off-peak hours. The stations Gare du Nord, Châtelet-Les Halles, Saint-Michel Notre-Dame, Luxembourg, Port-Royal, Denfert-Rochereau and Cité Universitaire are always served. Your ticket will allow you to transfer at one of the aforementioned stations to the Metro and other RER lines within Paris to complete your journey. The one-way trip costs €10.30 for adults, €7.20 for children aged 4–9, and free for children under 4.</p>
<p>Another option is the RoissyBus coach service that departs from all terminals and travels non-stop to Opéra (actually stops at 11 rue scribe, next to Place Charles Garnier, and not on Place de l'Opéra itself) in Central Paris, within easy walking distance of several stations: Opéra for Métro Lines 3, 7, 8; Auber for RER Line A; Chaussée d'Antin or Havre-Caumartin for Métro Line 9. It offers great value if you're travelling with lots of luggage; as of December 2023, a one-way ticket is €16.20. The buses are frequent, departing every 15 min during the day and every 20-30 min in the evening. Journey time is typically 60 minutes, but can take longer in heavy traffic.</p>
<p>If you arrive to CDG Airport at night you'll need a Noctilien bus to get to the city centre. The bus stops at all three terminals (in terminal 2F it will be the second level in the departure section, difficult to find, but it really exists). The bus leaves every 30 min after 00:30 (see timetable). The buses you'll need are N140 and N143; the price is 2 T+ tickets (€4 if bought on board).</p>
<p>48.72942.36822 Paris Orly Airport (ORY IATA), this older international airport is southwest of the city and is used mainly by Air France for domestic departures, and for several international departures, mostly towards destinations around the Mediterranean. It consists of two terminals: Terminal Sud (south) and Terminal Ouest (west) connected by people mover. The airport is connected with Paris by metro, tram and bus. See Paris Orly Airport for details.</p>

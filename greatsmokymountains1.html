<p>Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a United States national park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and an International Biosphere Reserve that straddles the border between Tennessee and North Carolina.  Because of its substantial size, its location within a few hundred miles of several large cities, its year-round accessibility, and of course its general appeal to a wide variety of people, it consistently ranks as the most-visited national park in the United States of America, with 9-10 million visits per year. In 2021, it had 14.1 million visitors. </p>
<p>The Great Smoky Mountains National Park was established on June 15, 1934 after a long process of land purchases starting in with Congress' authorization in 1926.  More than $11 million was required to make all of the purchases.  The main benefactor, who came to rescue during the Great Depression, was the Rockefeller family which donated $5 million.  This great deed was honored by the erection of a memorial at Newfound Gap.  The park was dedicated on September 2, 1940 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
<p>The park is almost 95% forested, with 25% of that being old-growth.  Almost 100 different types of native trees can be found in the park in addition to over 1,400 flowering plant species and 4,000 non-flowering plants.</p>
<p>The wildlife is abundant as well, featuring hundreds of different bird species, 66 mammal types, 50 types of native fish, as well as numerous reptiles and amphibians.</p>
<p>Several non-native species, both plant and animal, now call the park home and often threaten the native species.</p>
<p>Elevations in the park range from 800 feet (250 m) to 6,643 feet (2,025 m): the topography can drastically affect local weather. Temperatures can easily vary 10-20 °F (5-10 °C) from mountain base to top, and clear skies lower down do not guarantee equally pleasant weather at higher elevations. Rainfall averages 55 inches (140 cm) per year in the lowlands to 85 inches (215 cm) per year at Clingmans Dome.</p>
<p>Extreme weather changes are likely in this park. Be prepared for sudden temperature changes in any season of the year, including summer.</p>
<p>March through May: Spring brings with it unpredictable weather. Changes occur rapidly - sunny skies can yield to snow flurries in a few hours. March is the month with the most radical changes; snow can fall at any time during the month, particularly in the higher elevations. Temperatures in the lower elevations have a mean high of 61 °F (16 °C). Low temperatures, which are often below freezing, have a mean of 42 °F (6 °C). By mid-April the weather is usually milder. Daytime temperatures often reach the 70s and occasionally the 80s Fahrenheit (20s Celsius). Below freezing temperatures at night are uncommon in the lower elevations but still occur higher up. April averages over four inches of rain, usually in the form of afternoon showers. May is warmer, with daytime highs in the 70s and 80s (20s Celsius) and lows in the 40s and 50s (5–15 °C). May rainfall averages about 4.5 inches (11 cm).</p>

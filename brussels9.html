<p>Metro and underground tram stations are often a warm and dry refuge from the wet and cold weather in Brussels, and typically offer small convenience shops or coffee shops like Starbucks and the likes to sit out heavy showers. On the flip side, the metro in Brussels's cleanliness and safety are quite hit-and-miss compared to most metro systems; some stations are squeaky clean and modern, while others are dirty and in need of repair.</p>
<p>Brussels is one of those cities that likes to hide its metro stations. You may find them inside a shopping mall (De Brouckère), behind railings in a park (Parc), or several streets away from the location they purport to serve (Beurs). Don't bother trying to spot the  signs, which are the same colour as larger signs for one-way traffic and car parking. Instead, just ask locals for directions.</p>
<p>The official  dynamic STIB/MIVB network plan includes construction sites and replacement service (more network plans are also available).</p>
<p>The S-train can also be used for travel in the city. It is best for taking journeys from the center or a major train station to the outer edges, or the other way around. Some areas, especially in the north east, are easier to get to this way.</p>
<p>If you have a driver's license, then scooters may be a less physically exhausting alternative to bicycles to get around the city. 50.838844.386191 Scooty is a network of electric scooters available for rental throughout the city. Following a free roaming model, scooters can be found on public places in the city, and unlocked remotely by subscribers. After use, the scooter may be left at any public place. Although convenient considering Brussels' elevation, scooter rental is more expensive than Villo at €0.26/minute. Registration is €2.99.</p>
<p>Its rich history left Brussels dotted with countless landmarks, some of architectural beauty, others of monumental proportions. In the medieval centre, nearly every building has its own story worth exploring! The surrounding Pentagon, roughly corresponding to the outline of Brussels in the Renaissance, adds many more attractions to the list of must-see attractions. When the weather gets unpredictable, over 80 museums in the Brussels-Capital Region offer indoor excitement when rain prevents outdoor activities.</p>
<p>The most iconic sight in Brussels is its central square, the 50.8467084.3525381 Grand-Place , widely regarded as the most beautiful square in the world, and Brussels most famous  UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Grand-Place and its surrounding streets are the last remains of medieval Brussels, and offer a unique insight into the look and feel of the city a millennium ago. The city hall and its tower, seen on many post cards, is a landmark and orientation point from most of the centre. Manneken Pis, Brussels most famous statue, can be encountered in one of the side streets. As one of the most overrated attractions in Belgium, this insignificant statue is easily overlooked!  The Mary Magdalene Chapel and St. Nicholas Church are among the oldest churches in Belgium, and attraction poles for enthusiasts of religious architecture. A free tour starts in front of the city hall on the Grand Place every day at 10:00, 11:00, 13:30 and 14:00, and guides visitors along the most important sights in the centre.</p>

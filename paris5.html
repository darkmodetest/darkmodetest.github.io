See Paris Orly Airport for other rail options.</p>
<p>If you have luggage and don't want to take your chances on the train, the OrlyBus from Métro Denfert-Rochereau (lines 4 and 6 of the Metro and RER line "B") travels to the airport in 25-35 min in good traffic, although at rush hour travel times can be much longer.  The price is €11.20 as of December 2023. There are buses every 8-15 minutes from the Orly Sud (Platform 4) and it stops at Orly Ouest on its way to the city. Tickets can be bought at a counter near the baggage claim area or directly at the counter in Platform 4. The tickets need to be validated once on the bus. Another option is tramway T7 that takes you to the Métro Villejuif - Louis Aragon (Metro 7) in 30 min, but it stops on the way and is designed for commuters and not for travellers. Tramway T7 costs a single T+ (metro/bus/tram) ticket and runs every 10 min, stopping at airport level -1. Passes covering zones 1–4 are accepted, except that Tickets Jeunes are not valid on Orlybus.</p>

<p>Wi-Fi Internet access is provided free of charge.</p>
<p>49.45942.11393 Beauvais (BVA IATA), north of the city, is a smaller regional airport that is used by some low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and WizzAir. The airport operates a shuttle service to the Métro at Porte Maillot station. Buses run as early as 06:00. Buses leave 20 min after each flight arrives, and a few hours before each flight departs. A schedule can be found on the Beauvais Airport website. The journey will take about an hour in good traffic conditions, and costs €16.9 each way (Online) or €18 each way (Physically); there is no reduced price for children over the age of 2 years. Unless you hire a car this is the most realistic way to head toward Paris. The alternative is a train service between Gare du Nord and Beauvais, and a connecting shuttle or taxi to the airport. This journey costs more and takes longer. Missing the shuttle bus could mean a taxi fare well over €100.</p>
<p>Air France operates shuttles between Charles de Gaulle and Paris (€17), Orly and Paris (€12) and between the two airports (€20). Discounts apply for young/group travellers and online bookers. If you have connecting Air France flights that land and depart from different airports, you would still generally need to fetch your luggage after landing, catch either the Air France shuttle or a taxi (readily available at all airports) to the other airport and check-in again. This altogether could take up to 2 hours, particularly if traffic is at its worst. It is also common to lose time during disembarking, as passengers often need to get off on the tarmac and get on buses which will take them to the terminal. Be sure you have sufficient time between flights to catch your connection. Check-in counters usually close 30 min before the flight departs, longer if flights are international.</p>

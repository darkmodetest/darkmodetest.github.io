You can use a contactless payment device such as a credit card or smartphone wallets on the Total Access PATH Payment (TAPP) trial gates, or use a physical RFID card called SmartLink. Smartlink cards will NOT work on contactless OMNY readers for MTA subways or buses once in New York City, so visitors moving between New Jersey and New York City frequently may prefer the convenience of TAPP.</p>
<p>MetroCard is the tried-and-true pre-paid debit card for transit fares that will be phased out by 2024. MetroCards, which cost $1, can be bought online, at station booths, and at vending machines in subway stations, as well as at newsstands and some bodegas and convenience stores. The vending machines in the stations accept credit cards; however, MetroCard vending machines will require that you type in your 5-digit zip code, or your regular PIN on international cards. You can add either value or time (i.e. unlimited trips) to your MetroCard at vending machines in stations. Unlimited Ride MetroCards may not be used in rapid succession at the same subway station or on the same bus route. MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.</p>
<p>The PATH rapid transit rail system between New York and New Jersey has a separate fare structure. PATH accepts payment by MetroCard, but no free transfers are available to or from MTA subways or buses. JFK AirTrain also accepts MetroCard, but again there are no free transfers available.</p>
<p>Metro-North Commuter Railroad, Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), New Jersey Transit (NJT), and Amtrak trains do not accept MetroCards, but Westchester Bee Line Buses, Roosevelt Island Tram, and NICE Bus (Nassau Inter-County Express) do accept[dead link] them. OMNY is accepted on all subway stations and MTA-operated buses as well as Metro-North and LIRR; however it will not work on NJ Transit as NJT will be using a different fare payment system.</p>
<p>Up to three children 44 inches (112 cm) tall and under ride for free on subways and local buses when accompanied by a fare paying adult.</p>
<p>MetroCards generally expire 1 year after purchase; the expiration date is printed on the back of the card at the upper left.</p>
<p>A $1 fee is charged for each MetroCard purchased at station booths and vending machines. This fee does not apply when buying a card from neighborhood merchants, who may insist to be paid cash only (even if they otherwise accept credit cards with displayed logos), and if so, buy a lowest available pre-valued[dead link] $11.00 card that may be later refilled at MetroCard vending machine with credit card. However, expired MetroCards can be exchanged at station booths and vending machines free of charge, and the remaining balance will also be transferred to the new card. Most vending machines accept cash, but only return up to $9 in change. Debit and credit cards are accepted at vending machines; international card users need to input '99999' on the keypad when the ZIP code is requested. However, staffed station booths only accept cash, and no $50 bill if buying less than $30 or $100 bill if buying less than $70.</p>

From Amsterdam Centraal, most areas in the city centre can be reached within half an hour.</p>
<p>Public transport within the city is operated by the GVB. The tram is the main form of public transport and there is a metro and dozens of bus routes. Most routes operate from 06:00 (06:30 Saturdays and 07:45 Sundays) until around midnight. There are a few overnight bus routes as well. Regional buses, and some suburban buses, are operated by Connexxion and EBS.</p>
<p>For many years, an OV-chipkaart provided the only way to pay transportation fees in the city. However, as of 2023, fees may be paid at the station or on the tram, bus, or NS train by using a contactless credit or debit card. Many travellers find their credit card easier than buying and keeping track of an OV-chipkaart, as they do not have to obtain, maintain, and monitor the balance on the contactless card. User procedures (tapping in and out) on both kinds of cards are the same. To travel with a contactless card or an OV-chipkaart, you have to check in at the start of your journey and check out at the end by holding the card in front of the card reader.</p>
<p>Besides using a debit or credit card, you have other options: Three types of OV-chipkaart are available:</p>
<p>The first two types of cards come with no credit included and cost €7.50. To travel in the city you have to top up such a card for at least €4 before a journey begins. A disposable card, on the other hand, already has a product bundled with it, but it can not be re-used after this product expires.</p>
<p>Anonymous and disposable OV-chipkaarts can be obtained from GVB vending machines in all metro stations, from the desks at some larger stations (including Amsterdam Centraal) and some shops. Additionally 1-hour disposable cards can be bought on a tram or a bus but only PIN (debit and credit) cards are accepted to purchase them on board. After purchasing disposable cards from the driver or conductor, you must check in and check out with that card.</p>
<p>Tickets can also be purchased through the GVB mobile app - just scan the QR code on your mobile at the card reader.</p>
<p>For those who stay in Amsterdam longer, one of the day or multiple day passes[dead link] could be a useful option. You can get them for 24 hours up to 168 hours. This allows the holder to travel on an unlimited number of journeys on the tram, metro and bus throughout the validity period of the pass. Travel passes can be loaded on the anonymous cards but existing credit on such cards cannot be applied towards the purchase of a pass. These passes are not valid on buses operated by Connexxion and Arriva. These passes can be purchased at tourist offices (at Schiphol Airport and just outside Amsterdam Centraal), AKO bookstores, many hotels and GVB ticket offices. Additionally, a one-day pass can be purchased from the conductor on a tram (but not on a bus).</p>

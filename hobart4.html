Many of the exhibits, particularly in the museums, have a distinct Antarctic theme, a result of Hobart's long history of being a Gateway City to East Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) is among the best museums in Australia has and has fast become a Hobart icon.</p>
<p>Hobart is one of the most easily accessible places to view the Southern Lights or Aurora Australis. Your chances depend on the space weather, and to have a good chance of seeing the aurora you'll want a K-Index above 6. You can see the current K-Index (updated every 20 minutes) at the Australia Space Weather Services. They have forecasts there for space weather for the next several days.</p>
<p>If you find gambling and betting entertaining then Hobart has a modest set of venues for you to explore. The most well known is Wrest Point Casino, which happens to be the very first legal casino built in Australia. Other options include the local racecourse for horse and hound racing along with various lotteries and statewide betting agencies.</p>
<p>Hobart is fast becoming a cultural hub within Tasmania and boasts some well known theatres and music venues, including the famous Theatre Royal. Those looking for local music gigs should check out The Dwarf Gig Guide for Tasmania. The guide has information on all live music gigs for the next month in advance.</p>
<p>The Greater Hobart region is part of the Southern Wine Route in Tasmania. Owing to the cool climate this region is known for producing a superb range of cool-climate wines including cabernet sauvignon, chardonnay, gewurztraminer, pinot gris, pinot noir, riesling and sauvignon blanc. Hobart's primary wine growing region, Coal River Valley, lies just east of the Derwent River around Cambridge and  Richmond. There are also other wineries around Hobart, including north around the Derwent Valley and west around the Huon Trail. Be sure to check out Wine Tasmania, which has further information on Tasmania's wine regions.</p>
<p>Due to the distances and lack of public transport to many of the wineries, the best way of visiting them is by car. There are also places that organised tours, usually on weekends, such as Boutique Wine Tours.</p>
<p>Sure you could head on over to one of the national supermarket chains, Coles and Woolworths, but why do that when Hobart is brimming with plenty of unique providores, delis and specialty food stores for you to sample some of Tasmania's finest food and produce.</p>
<p>Hobart has a profusion of eating establishments ranging from the cheap to the luxuriously expensive. Freshly caught seafood is a specialty of the region, and there are several excellent seafood restaurants. Deep-sea Trevalla is unique to Tasmania and must be tried. Tasmanian lobster is also excellent. Scallop pie is also unique to Tasmania and can be easily purchased from the Salamanca Market food stalls. Restaurants are concentrated in the Salamanca and North Hobart areas.</p>

The enormous conflagration cost $120 million to fight and at one point seriously threatened both the Old Faithful Inn and the historic buildings in Mammoth. The blaze was so powerful that it actually jumped across a river canyon, and media reports at the time often gave the erroneous impression that the park had been completely destroyed. Since the fire, the park management plan has changed. A contributing factor to the severity of the 1988 fire was the buildup of fuel from years of fire suppression, so today natural wildfires are allowed to burn unless they are deemed a danger. Most importantly, the fires of 1988 demonstrated the importance of fire to the natural ecosystem in restoring soil nutrients, dispersing seeds of fire-resistant plants such as lodgepole pines, and creating grazing land for animals like elk and bison.</p>
<p>There are a huge number of day hikes available in the park, and since many visitors travel only to the most popular geyser basins these trails can provide an opportunity to see the park in a more natural setting.</p>
<p>Every major village within the park offers food, camping supplies, and souvenirs for sale, although these stores all close during the winter months.</p>
<p>Gasoline and automotive services are available in the following locations:</p>
<p>Most of the villages sell food supplies and may offer snack bars. The following restaurants and cafeterias are also available:</p>
<p>Cocktails can be purchased in the lodge restaurants, and lighter beverages can be obtained at the snack bars.</p>
<p>While there are an abundance of hotels and campgrounds within the park, they fill quickly in the summer so visitors may also want to consider lodging options in the gateway towns of West Yellowstone and Gardiner.</p>
<p>Lodging in the park fills quickly and should be booked in advance. Cancellations are common, so if a particular lodging option is unavailable it is a good idea to re-check frequently to see if it becomes available. Reservations for all lodges and cabins in the park can be made through Xanterra Parks & Resorts or by calling (307) 344-7311. All park accommodations are non-smoking and, reflecting the natural surroundings of Yellowstone, televisions, radios, air conditioning, and Internet hook-ups are not available. During the winter the only lodging within the park is the Old Faithful Snow Lodge and the Mammoth Hotel.  Getting to the Old Faithful Snow Lodge requires traveling over snow-covered roads, which usually means reserving a seat on the snowcoach at a cost of about $150 per person.</p>
<p>Campgrounds may fill by early morning, especially during peak season (early July - late August). Recreational vehicles over 30 ft (9.1 m) should make reservations since there is a limited number of RV sites available in Yellowstone. Large RV sites are at Flag Ranch, Fishing Bridge RV Park and West Yellowstone. Reservations should be made well in advance and/or campsites should be secured as early in the day as possible.</p>

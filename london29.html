Its universities include some of the oldest and most prestigious in the world. The University of London is a federal university system with many constituent colleges, though for all practical purposes each constituent college operates as a separate university. London School of Economics and Political Science is located on the boundary of Covent Garden and Holborn in Westminster, 18 Nobel Prize winners and 50 world leaders have studied here. The School offers a well-regarded lecture programme that is open to the public. Speakers have included Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, the Dalai Lama and Paul Krugman. Event schedule and ticket information available from the LSE website.

<p>London is a natural place to learn and improve spoken and written English. There are a huge range of options, from informal language exchange services to evening classes and formal language schools. There are unaccredited schools charging hefty fees and offering qualifications that are viewed as worthless. If choosing a course from a privately-run school or college, it is important to ensure the institution is accredited by the British Council.</p>
<p>Some links to British Council accredited schools:</p>
<p>London is one of the world's leading financial centres and so professional services is the main area of employment. It is best to check with recruiters and staffing agencies.</p>
<p>London is hugely popular as a working holiday destination - work in bars and the hospitality industry is relatively easy to find.</p>
<p>Wages are generally higher in London than the rest of the UK, in part due to the addition of London weighting, although the cost of living is higher still.</p>
<p>London, like the rest of the UK, uses the British pound sterling.</p>
<p>Retail prices for most items, with a few exceptions, always include VAT (at 20%). Visa and MasterCard/Maestro are the two most commonly accepted debit/credit cards, although most large shops will also accept American Express. If your card does not have a microchip (for Chip & PIN) some machines (for instance, at Tube stations) will be unable to read your card. Some shops may ask you for additional identification, especially in relation to high-value items, or items that are under age-related restrictions. Most shops no longer accept personal cheques. Contactless or NFC-enabled Visa and MasterCard cards can also be used for purchases of usually up to Â£100 in lieu of Chip & Pin, even on London Underground fare gates and buses.</p>

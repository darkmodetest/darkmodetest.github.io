Ralphs and Vons both have a few stores open 24-7. They are useful for picking up supplies like drinks and snacks if your flight arrives late at night.</p>
<p>The largest big box retailer, Walmart, has no stores in or near the Los Angeles city limits south of the Santa Monica Mountains (though there are stores in other cities in southern Los Angeles County).  Walmart Supercenters can be found in West Hills, Porter Ranch, Panorama City, and Burbank and generally close at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>Target, the second largest American big box retailer, has stores in Westwood, West Hollywood, Beverly Grove, Baldwin Hills and Downtown L.A.  Some are open till midnight, others close at 11 p.m.  </p>
<p>Whole Foods Market, a national upscale grocery store chain, has stores across Los Angeles.  The two local upscale grocery store chains are Gelson's and Bristol Farms. All three chains tend to have higher prices than the large supermarket chains listed above.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles area is one of the best places in the country for food - you can find just about anything you can imagine somewhere within its loose borders. From traditional American diner culture (try Mel's Drive-In in West Hollywood) to the new wave of organic cafes, to inexpensive taco trucks, and swanky eateries with breath-taking food, there is no shortage of options.</p>
<p>Los Angeles abounds with inexpensive, authentic food that represents the culinary traditions of L.A.'s many immigrant communities. You have to be willing to do a little legwork, go to neighborhoods you might not otherwise go to and often deal with charmless fluorescent-lit storefronts in strip malls, but your reward is hype-free, authentic cuisine from around the world served up at bargain prices. The late and dearly missed food critic Jonathan Gold found and reviewed these gems starting in the 1980s, mostly for the free LA Weekly before he moved to the food section of the LA Times, and most of his reviews are still relevant today.</p>
<p>The newest arrival on the L.A. food scene is the gourmet food truck.  These are not your average taco trucks and construction-site catering operations (although those exist too), but purveyors of creative and surprisingly high-quality food.  Food trucks, particularly taco trucks, can be found in most parts of the city.  A few noteworthy food trucks are "Grill Em All," run by 2 metalheads doing outstanding gourmet hamburgers, "Nom Nom," doing Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, and "Kogi," doing Korean-inspired tacos and burritos.  Many trucks also have their own websites and post their daily schedules and locations on Twitter.</p>
<p>On the opposite spectrum from food trucks, those seeking high-end dining have some of the country's finest restaurants to choose from.  While the Michelin guide stopped reviewing Los Angeles in 2010, Beverly Hills had several eateries that were rated by Michelin, including Wolfgang Puck's first restaurant, Spago.  While there are numerous destinations for an upscale meal throughout the LA area, Santa Monica is notable as the only city besides Beverly Hills that can lay claim to multiple Michelin starred restaurants.</p>

Casa Del Gelato is a Lygon St gelato institution which always has several vegan flavours.</p>
<p>Vegans looking to experience the city's coffee culture will find soy, oat, or almond milk at most cafes.</p>
<p>Melbourne's Little Vietnams are in Footscray, North Richmond and Springvale out in the far eastern suburbs. The streets in these areas are lined with pho (noodle) shops and restaurants offering other Vietnamese favourites. Many outlets have also appeared along Swanston Street in the City Centre. However, for convenience to the city and reasonable prices, Victoria Street in North Richmond is your best bet.</p>
<p>Spanish, Argentinian, Burmese and Polish restaurants can be found in the Richmond/Collingwood/Prahran area.</p>
<p>Melbourne has some Cajun/Creole restaurants and one or two American style diners, but US cuisine is otherwise absent: Foods like Southern-style barbecue and clam chowder are nearly impossible to find.</p>
<p>Korean restaurants are well represented and are scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p>Hopetoun Tea Rooms in Block Arcade on Little Collins Street offer sweets ranging from cakes and pastries to high tea.</p>
<p>Ice cream and gelato are popular post-dinner snacks in the warmer months. Try Piccolina and Messina, although don't be surprised if the line stretches outside in summer.</p>
<p>Melbournians often draw a distinction between 'bars', meaning the small watering holes described above, and 'pubs', which are larger establishments in the usual Australian or British sense of the word. Melbourne's pubs, particularly those in the city and inner suburbs, usually serve restaurant-standard food and a wide range of local and imported beers.  Pubs usually offer lunch from approximately noon to 2PM, and reopen their kitchens for dinner from approximately 6-10PM.</p>
<p>Gay, lesbian and transgender party goers are welcome everywhere as Melbournians are on the whole very tolerant and welcoming people. Perhaps the one bad thing is that nothing really starts happening until midnight!</p>
<p>The city centre has a number of pubs, the most famous being the Young and Jackson.  Melbourne is also famous for its many trendy bars in the CBD.  Most of these, however, are down narrow alleys and streets, and are therefore hard to find unless you know where you are going.</p>
<p>The inner northern suburbs, such as Collingwood and Fitzroy cater for the young, laid-back, and bohemian crowd. Here you will find lots of live music, cheaper prices, and a relaxed atmosphere. Head for Brunswick and Gertrude Streets in Fitzroy and Smith Street, Collingwood for cafes, bars and live music, while Lygon Street, Carlton has a range of Italian restaurants and cafes with a student vibe, as it's located near the University of Melbourne. Victoria Street, North Richmond is the heart of Melbourne's Vietnamese community, with many cheap and cheerful restaurants serving good food.</p>
<p>Melbourne nightlife is  24 hours, loud, colourful and anything goes. Door policies can be strict but once inside high quality entertainment is guaranteed. DJ's, live music, artists and beautiful people can be found. There truly is something for everyone and every taste. It has a massive live music scene, with many inner-suburbs pubs catering to many genres, with drink and food specials all week. The key is to find one you like the most!</p>

<p>Brussels (French: Bruxelles, Dutch: Brussel) is the capital of Belgium and one of the three administrative regions within the country, together with Flanders and Wallonia. Apart from its role within its country, it is also an internationally important city, hosting numerous international institutions, and in particular the headquarters of NATO and the core institutions of the European Union. Due to that, it is sometimes referred to informally as the capital of the EU, and even used as a metonym for the EU institutions.</p>
<p>Brussels blends the heritage of a medieval Flemish town with the grandiose projects initiated after it became the capital of what was then a French-speaking country, as well as some impressive modern architecture erected in a large part to house the international institutions. Brussels is now bilingual, hosting and officially recognizing the Dutch- and French-speaking communities of Belgium, and has become increasingly international with the influx of people of various origin who came there to work, many of them for the European Union. This all makes Brussels a rather unique blend, sprinkled with a number of Belgian peculiarities, and for the inquisitive tourist a large treasure chest to discover.</p>

<p>Within the Belgian federation, Brussels enjoys a large degree of autonomy. Although dependent on Belgium for matters such as defense and foreign policy, Brussels has its own government in charge of interior affairs, environmental policies, health care, economy, transport, tourism and education, and its own laws regarding these matters. The city has control over its own administrative region (the Brussels-Capital Region), which is on the same level as Flanders and Wallonia in Belgium. This status of a city state within a host country is somewhat comparable to Vatican City and Hong Kong. The political autonomy of Brussels has drawn international interest as the host for politically independent entities such as the European Institutions (the European Commission and European Parliament), and the NATO headquarters. Brussels is a strongly internationally oriented metropolis, and despite shared languages, inhabitants identify as Brusseleirs rather than Flemes or Walloons.</p>
<p>When Brussels became the capital city of a new country in the 19th century, large parts of the old town were destroyed to make way for brand new ministries, palaces, schools, army barracks and office blocks constructed between 1880 and 1980. The medieval city walls that once defended and surrounded the city were demolished. Only a small historic centre (one square and four adjacent streets) was preserved. The historic Flemish town centres are better preserved in cities like Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Leuven, and Mechelen. This thoughtless treatment of historic buildings has earned past city planners near-universal scorn and even given rise to the term "Brusselization" for cities that similarly tear down old buildings, replacing them with faceless concrete monstrosities.</p>
<p>Brussels has an oceanic climate. Although Brussels' weather has historically been famous for being awful and damp, the city has become warmer in the last decades. It features moderately cold, wet winters and warm, variable summers. Rainfall is equally distributed throughout the year, with a slight peak in the period from November to January and May to June.</p>

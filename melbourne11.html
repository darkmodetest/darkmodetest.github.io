<p>Melbourne is home to several universities, two of which belong to the prestigious "Group of Eight": the University of Melbourne and Monash University. There are opportunities for international students to enrol in these universities, either in their degree programmes or through exchange agreements with foreign universities, and these are opportunities for foreigners to live in Melbourne for an extended period of time. There are also dual sector institutions such as RMIT University and Victoria University that provide vocational training and short courses. </p>
<p>The most popular industry for a working holiday is to work in hospitality jobs around the St. Kilda area. The wages in all other industries are usually much better than working in hospitality but require more specific skills.</p>
<p>Fruit picking is a possible source of income but in the greater Melbourne area not many jobs are offered. You will find better chances are in the dairy business but you should have some basic experience. Grape vine tending is another possibility in the nearby Yarra Valley.</p>
<p>Australia has the second highest minimum wage in the world (after Denmark). Note that casual workers (those who do not work regular or guaranteed hours) must be paid a loading of at least 20% over the award wage. The amount of loading varies by industry. Find out the wage your should be getting by using the Pay Calculator.</p>
<p>Most visitor visas prohibit the holder from any employment, but working holiday and student visas may allow foreigners to work, but these visas come with restrictions on hours of work allowed among other restrictions. Please make sure you have the right work before doing so as working without the right to work is a deportable offence.  If any workplace health and safety issues arise, you may contact WorkSafe Victoria, Victoria's health and safety regulator and manager of Victoria's workers compensation scheme. If you believe your employer is not complying with Australian workplace laws, you can also contact FairWork Ombudsman.</p>

And outside peak hours, a ride by bus from the tip of Lower Manhattan at Battery Park to Midtown is a good and cheap way of taking in the sights.</p>
<p>Taxis are widely available in New York, but due to surface traffic, it is often quicker to take the subway — or in Midtown Manhattan, to walk.</p>
<p>In some areas, livery cabs can be flagged on the street. Though this is not legal (the driver, not you, could get into trouble), it is useful in upper Manhattan and the outer boroughs and is accepted practice, though this has mostly been replaced by the Borough Taxis and ride hailing apps. The minimum fare in these cabs is about $7, and it is advisable to negotiate the fare before you get inside (again, tipping your driver is expected). Since yellow cabs are hard to come by in the outer boroughs, these cars are particularly useful for getting to the airport (your hotel can arrange one, or look up car services in the Yellow Pages).</p>

<p>As if you need another reason to avoid driving into Manhattan, the MTA has plans to introduce a congestion pricing scheme which will charge motor vehicles for entering Manhattan below 60th Street via license plate scanners. Passenger vehicles would be charged $15 to enter the area between 9AM and 9PM (limited to once per day, so leaving and reentering the zone in the same day would not incur a second charge); larger vehicles would be charged up to $36. Taxis would be charged $1.25 per trip into the zone, while other for-hire vehicles such as for Uber will be charged $2.50 per trip. Entering the zone after 9PM would incur a 75% discount; entering the area via the tunnels which already charge tolls (Queens-Midtown, Brooklyn-Battery, Holland, Lincoln) would also see a reduction. The charge does not apply to vehicles that stay on the West Side Highway or FDR Drive. Vehicles without E-ZPass would incur a 50% surcharge. Lawsuits have been filed by various groups which oppose the plan for various reasons and seek a legal order to prevent its implementation.</p>
<p>The plan had been set to take effect on June 30, 2024, but on June 5 New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced an indefinite delay to the plan, preventing the MTA from implementing it as scheduled. Hochul lifted the pause in November and the MTA voted to reinstate the plan effective January 5, 2025.</p>
<p>A word of advice about driving in New York City: don't. A car is inadvisable — street parking is practically nonexistent near crowded areas and tourist attractions, and garage parking rates range from very expensive to plain extortion. Traffic is almost always congested, parking rules are confusing, and many drivers are infamously aggressive. Public transportation options are many, and are quicker, cheaper and more pleasant. That's why many New Yorkers, particularly in Manhattan, don't own cars. If you think of staying in a suburb and commuting to the city by car, better to do as the locals do. Drive to one of the commuter rail stations (see above) or ferry docks. Parking fees at the station, fare, and MetroCard combined are usually much cheaper than parking downtown. Many stations have secure parking areas; however, it’s wise to investigate beforehand. Some suburban stations limit their parking to local residents, with enforcement by license plate camera and aggressive ticketing of unregistered vehicles. In Staten Island, parking near the ferry terminal and using the ferry will save you money and time.</p>

Visitors will notice that, as of 2024, there is not a single road with a bicycle lane on the whole island. Riding on the major highways is also not recommended, because they are barely wide enough for the trucks and buses which thunder down them. That said, cycling is very possible and pleasant in less-developed areas. The trouble with these areas is they are usually very mountainous. Additionally, there is no way to get your bicycle there other than riding it there. For this reason, use a tour operator who takes you there and provides the bicycles. </p>
<p>One popular bicycle route is Kintamani to Gianyar, 36 km of downhill or flat terrain through paddy fields, villages, and temples. Tour operators can pick you up at your hotel and take you to Kintamani where bicycles await.</p>
<p>If you want to buy a bicycle, there are about a dozen bike shops in Bali, mostly in Denpasar. Bicycles are also available for rent and some of the better hotels will even provide them free of charge. </p>
<p>Bali's best known attractions are its countless Hindu temples. Each village is required by adat (customary law) to construct and maintain at least three temples: the pura puseh (temple of origin) at the kaja (pure) side of the village, the pura desa (village temple) at the centre for everyday community activities and the pura dalem (temple of the dead) at the kelod (unclean) end. Wealthy villages may well have more than these three obligatory temples, and additionally all family compounds have a temple of some nature.</p>
<p>The nine directional temples (kayangan jagat) are the largest and most prominent. These are at strategic points across Bali and are designed to protect the island and its inhabitants from dark forces. Pura Luhur Uluwatu (Uluwatu Temple), at the southern tip of Bali, is easily accessed and hence very popular, as is Tanah Lot. For the Balinese, the "mother temple" of Besakih on the slopes of Mount Agung is the most important of all and sits above the nine. The other seven directional temples are Goa Lawah, Pura Lempuyang Luhur, Pura Luhur Batukaru, Pura Masceti, Pura Pasar Agung, Pura Ulun Danu Batur, and Pura Ulun Danu Bratan. All of these are on either rugged high ground or at the water's edge, and this is a clear indication of the likely source of dark forces as far as the Balinese are concerned.</p>
<p>Balinese temple design is an involved subject and one that baffles many visitors. Local geography has a fundamental effect on design, and two temples are rarely the same. Everything you see, be it decorative or structural, has a specific, well considered function which may be of an earthly or spiritual nature. There are, though, general elements which are common to the vast majority of temples, which are always split into three courtyards: jaba (outer courtyard), jaba tengah (middle courtyard) and  jeroan (inner courtyard). Each of these courtyards contains various structures and/or shrines of differing levels of importance.</p>

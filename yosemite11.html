These are walk-in sites offered for people with valid wilderness permits to stay the night before and the night after their backcountry trips. For more information contact the Yosemite Valley Wilderness Center or any park campground office.</p>
<p>Use Southside Drive to get to the Pines Campgrounds. Do not cross the Sentinel Bridge, but make a right turn just before this bridge.
If staying in the North Pines, cross the river at Clark's Bridge. (The one-way roads in the valley have been reversed to make it easier to get to the campground.)</p>
<p>Backcountry permits are free and are required year-round for all overnight trips into Yosemite's wilderness. Wilderness areas operate under a quota system that limits the number of people who may begin overnight hikes from each trailhead, each day. While permits may be reserved for $5 per party plus $5 per person, at least 40% of each trailhead quota is available on a first-come first-served basis the day of, or one day prior to, the beginning of your trip.</p>
<p>Permits can be obtained in person from the wilderness stations in Yosemite Village, Big Oak Flat, Tuolumne Meadows, Badger Pass, Hetch Hetchy and Wawona. In addition, permits can be reserved up to 24 weeks in advance for a fee. There are three ways to reserve a wilderness permit, and forms for advance reservations can be found on the Yosemite wilderness permit web site:</p>
<p>All backcountry campers are expected to leave the wilderness in the same condition as they find it; this means no trash, fire scars, or other evidence of a visit should be left behind. Backcountry campsites must be at least four trail miles from Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point, Hetch Hetchy or Wawona, or at least one trail mile from any road. Groups are limited in size to 15 people, including guides and small children. Pets, weapons, bicycles, strollers, and mechanized vehicles of any kind are not allowed in the wilderness areas, while fires are only allowed in existing fire circles, and are not allowed above 9,600 ft (2,900 m) elevation.</p>
<p>Bear canisters are required in all areas of the Park and highly recommended in areas close to Yosemite's borders. These canisters must be used for food storage, as well as for storing scented toiletries such as soap, deodorant and toothpaste, and should be stashed at least 100 m from your campsite. Canisters can be rented from the ranger station where you pick up your backcountry permit for $5, good for up to two weeks. Bear canisters are not just to protect hikers' food––they protect bears. There is no good excuse for conditioning bears to rely on human food.</p>
<p>For any emergency in Yosemite National Park, dial 911 from most phones (hotel and retail phones may require 9+911). Yosemite NPS runs its own dedicated emergency dispatch. If you dial from a cell phone, first mention that you are in Yosemite as many cell phones route to a call center in your number's area code.</p>

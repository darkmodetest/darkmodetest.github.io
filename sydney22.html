It is highly popular among students from the nearby University of Sydney.</p>
<p>Sydney is also home to some of the world's best restaurants and their chefs. But if you want to try Sydney's finest rated restaurants during your visit, a booking must usually be made well in advance. There's Tetsuyaâ€™s and Est in the City Centre, Marque in the City East and Flying Fish Restaurant & Bar in Pyrmont. Another famous Sydney celebrity chef is Neil Perry, who runs Rockpool at The Rocks, as well as the Rockpool Bar and Grill in the city, not far from Circular Quay, with Spice Temple downstairs.</p>
<p>If you want to splurge on the location, try Quay in The Rocks or Matt Moran's Aria, both of which have harbour and bridge views.</p>
<p>For fine dining away from central Sydney, try Jonah's in the far Northern Beaches - go for lunch, the view is stunning.</p>
<p>Takeaway (takeout) food in Sydney can be as cheap as buying the ingredients and making it yourself, and many stores specialise in take-away food. There will usually be a picnic table, park or beach nearby to eat whatever you can select. Quintessential Aussie takeaways include the meat pie (minced beef with gravy sauce in a crusty pastry shell), sausage roll (sausage mince in a puff pastry casing), usually topped generously with tomato sauce/ketchup, and fish and chips (inherited from the British to be sure but loved by all Australians).</p>
<p>Most restaurants will do take-away food as well, but almost certainly at a premium to the cost of buying food from a take-away. Outside of the city an occasional restaurant may offer a 10% discount for take-away. There are a few online services like Menulog that allow users to order food online from the variety of restaurants and take away in a particular area.</p>
<p>Just about every suburb in Sydney has a restaurant or two, a cafe or coffee shop, and a place that sells takeaway food. However, there are a number of places in Sydney where you can window shop through many restaurants and make your choice.</p>
<p>All of Darling Harbour is like this, there are restaurants of every variety all along the waterfront. East Circular Quay in the City Centre is similar, along with the International Passenger Terminal on the west of Circular Quay - however many of the restaurants in this area are expensive and loved more for the view than the quality of the food. There are (pricey) exceptions, such as Cafe Sydney, Aria and Sailors Thai.</p>
<p>In the east of the city, Victoria Street in Darlinghurst and Crown Street in Surry Hills (between Oxford and Cleveland Streets) has a large range of funky cafes, small bars, pubs, patisseries and restaurants. Darlinghurst and Surry Hills has it all, from cheap Asian take-aways to high end restaurants. Many trendy restaurants in this area don't take bookings; often you wait at the bar for a table. These suburbs are popular with hipsters, yuppies and the gay community.</p>

The trains can also be empty when they get towards the end of the line at this time. Don't expect a taxi to be waiting at every station - only the major ones will have a well patronised taxi rank. Drunk people are common on trains late at night, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. In the CBD, trains tend to be busy into the evening, and obnoxious behaviour is more common than any actual danger.</p>
<p>For your safety, travel in the carriage closest to the guard's compartment, which is marked with a blue light on the outside of the train. If you ever feel concerned for your safety on any train, or even if you encounter anti-social activity, you can call 1800 657 926 to speak with security, who can sometimes arrange for a transit patrol to board the train and provide assistance. You can also seek assistance from the guard. In more modern trains, you can press the button in the entry area to contact the guard. Every train station has an orange emergency help point monitored by CCTV that connects to security, usually towards the centre of the platform.</p>
<p>Nightride buses, which replace trains after midnight, can arrange for a taxi to meet you when you get off. Ask the driver.</p>
<p>If you are going to the beach, take the same precautions as you do anywhere in Australia. See Australia beach safety.</p>
<p>The main thing to remember when swimming at any beach is to swim between the yellow and red flags. These flags are placed by the lifeguards and indicate the safest place to swim at the beach away from dangerous currents.</p>
<p>Sydney has no really dangerous jellyfish. Bluebottles (Portuguese Man-Of-War) are blueish-purple stingers that hit the Sydney beaches a couple of days every summer, when the wind direction is right. They have an air-bladder that floats on the water, and stinging tentacles. Often the air-bladder can be no bigger than a coin. You will see the evidence of them with their air-bags washed up on the beach if they are present. They can give a painful sting - even when on the beach - but it won't keep everyone out of the water. Apply a heat pack if you can, or ice, or salt water. The best way to remove the pain is to run the affected area under the hottest water you can stand. Vinegar is useless. Sometimes small transparent jellyfish appear in the harbour and estuaries. You can usually avoid any groups of them, but they are mostly harmless. More rarely larger purple jellyfish are in the harbour and other estuaries. If you see these in the estuaries, best to stay out of their way. Probably more of an issue to water skiers than to swimmers.</p>
<p>Sydney ocean beaches all have shark mesh nets around 100 metres out to sea, and are regularly patrolled by air for sharks. A shark alarm will sound if any are sighted, and you should get out of the water. The risk of shark attack swimming on a patrolled beach between the flags is low. Shark attacks are rare on Sydney beaches, but they have occurred. Advice is to avoid swimming in murky water after storms, or at dusk or at dawn, and to swim in the netted enclosures within the harbour and other estuaries.</p>

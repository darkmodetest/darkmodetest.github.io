<p>The suburban rail network is great for quickly getting to outlying suburban areas. All services stop at Perth station in the City on their way to or from the suburbs. The network consists of the following eight lines:</p>
<p>Train services run every 5â€“10 minutes during peak hours. Trains run every 15 min during off-peak hours and on weekends. Services commence around 5AM and cease around midnight. Additional services depart Perth at 1AM and 2AM on Saturday and Sunday mornings. These services cater to people returning home from night clubs in Northbridge. These services operate in one direction only, heading away from the city. Trackwork can cause partial line closures on weekends, with buses replacing trains. It is rare for a whole line to be closed due to track work, but it does occur at least twice a year on most lines.</p>
<p>During peak hours the Yanchep (north) and Midland (east) lines can become extremely overcrowded. Avoid these lines during peak if possible. Bicycles are not allowed on trains heading toward the city in the morning peak, or away from the city in the evening peak; they are also not allowed to enter or pass through Perth, Perth Underground or Elizabeth Quay stations during peak hours. Passengers with bikes should use stations just outside the CBD (City West, McIver, Canning Bridge or Leederville) during this time, and then ride to the final destination from there.</p>
<p>Most train stations across Perth have bus transfers that service the more local area of the station. The Perth Busport in the CBD is directly connected to Perth Station. The Elizabeth Quay Bus Station in the CBD is directly connected to Elizabeth Quay Station on the Mandurah and Yanchep Lines.</p>
<p>A reasonably reliable network of public buses serves the city centre, suburbs and outlying townships, with good interconnections between routes and with metro rail services. Most routes run hourly in the off-peak and every 20 to 30 minutes during peak hours, although the exact frequency varies by route. Some routes only run on weekdays, and some only have a limited number of services each day. High frequency routes run every 15 minutes, and some of these routes can be even more frequent. The "Super Bus" between Morley and UWA runs every two minutes in the peak, for example.</p>
<p>Transport buses also serve rural towns and villages near Perth. Some bus routes travel to far-flung areas like Serpentine and Pinjarra. These routes only operate a few times a day, and some stops may appear to be in the middle of nowhere. Some bus routes can be extremely long. The CircleRoute, for example, takes four and a half hours to complete a full trip. Suburban buses do not have toilets on board, so be prepared to get off mid-journey for a toilet break or hold it in!</p>

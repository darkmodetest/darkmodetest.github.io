Fares range from ¥3 to ¥10, with the Capital Airport Express costing ¥25 and the Daxing Airport Express between ¥10 and ¥35. Tickets are valid only on the day of purchase from the station where they were issued, so keep your ticket handy for both entry and exit.</p>
<p>Most stations have ticket machines with English instructions, though some stations, like Tian’anmen East, require a Chinese ID or a Foreigner's Permanent Resident ID Card for machine transactions. Other travelers can buy tickets at manned counters found at each station, though not every entrance/exit is staffed, and counter staff rarely speak English. Alternatively, you can purchase tickets using the smartphone app for the Beijing Transportation Card. Frequent travelers may find a Beijing Transportation Card more convenient; it allows quick tap access at turnstiles and can be refunded at major stations like Xizhimen and Haidianhuangzhuang.</p>
<p>Due to Beijing’s high population, rush hours can be crowded, especially on lines 1, 4, 10, and 13. Avoid peak times if possible, and keep an eye on personal belongings in crowded areas. Each station has X-ray security checks for bags, and passengers carrying liquids may be asked to drink a sip in front of security staff.</p>

<p>Transfers are mostly seamless, except for airport express lines, which require separate tickets.</p>
<p>Once known as a nation of bicycles, China saw private cars dominate the roads from the 1990s until the 2010s. However, the arrival of several dockless ridesharing bike companies, each with a distinctive color, has transformed Beijing back into a city of bikes. These bikes are now crowded everywhere and waiting at every subway station exit. The infrastructure from Beijing's days as the capital of the "Bicycle Kingdom" makes exploring the city by bike excellent. The city is flat, and all major streets have bike lanes. Bicycling is often faster than traveling by car, taxi, or bus due to traffic congestion in the motorized lanes.</p>
<p>Four-wheeled motorized traffic in Beijing usually observes traffic signals with the exception of making turns at red lights which is often done without slowing or deferring to pedestrians or bicyclists. Pedestrians, bicycles and all other vehicles (for example, motorized bicycles, mopeds and tricycles) generally do not observe traffic signals. Also, cars, trucks and buses do not defer to cyclists on the road so it is common for a vehicle to make a right turn from an inside lane across a bike lane with no concern for cyclists traveling in the bike lane. Sometimes a right-turning vehicle crossing a bike lane will sound its horn as a warning, but not always. Cyclists also need to be on the lookout for wrong-way traffic in the bike lanes, usually bicycles and tricycles but sometimes motor vehicles, too. Wrong-way traffic usually stays close to the curb so you move to the left to get by them, but not always. Bicycling Beijingers tend not to wear helmets, nor do they use lights at night. Few bikes even have rear reflectors. The moderate pace and sheer numbers of bicyclists in Beijing appear to make bike travel safer than it would be otherwise.</p>

If you engage in any risky activity, always protect yourself.</p>
<p>Finally, be careful around monkeys. They may be habituated to humans, but they are wild animals, and being bitten or scratched by a monkey could result in your contracting any number of maladies, possibly including rabies. So you are best off keeping your distance, especially if a monkey seems to be behaving erratically. If you are bitten or scratched by a monkey or bat, get medical help immediately, as rabies, if not treated before symptoms occur, is almost 100% fatal.</p>
<p>Owing to overtourism and Bali's attractiveness as a cheap, mass-market tourist destination, some visitors end up doing stupid things in Bali. Now, more than ever, they are likely to be caught and punished. In February 2024, the Balinese government launched a new tourist police unit to deal with troublemaking foreigners. As of April 2024, this force comprises over 70 officers. In 2023, the Balinese government deported 340 foreigners for overstaying visas, working illegally, and behaving inappropriately at sacred places such as temples. This is an increase of 80% over the number of deportations for 2022. It goes without saying that foreign visitors should behave respectfully when visiting sacred sites, and, if you encounter police, follow their instructions and keep your cool.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is very unlikely you will find a working public telephone on the street, which can be very frustrating in emergency situations. Depending on your circumstances, you may have to rely on mobile phones (local SIM cards may be used in unlocked phones with economical local and international calling rates) or phone/internet shops. Budget accommodation options are unlikely to offer telephone services to guests. Private rental phone booths (frequently together with internet rental) are available almost everywhere in Bali, mostly in Kuta and Legian, but the number is decreasing, because of cheap mobile phone prices which can easily be obtained for under Rp 300,000. Around Kuta and Legian, there are Biznet WiFi spots which are very fast and easy to use from your device. The voucher can be bought in Alfamart: Rp 10,000 for 500MB/10 days or Rp 30,000 for 2GB/30 days, and can be used in up to 2 devices.</p>
<p>It is worth investing in a SIM card for your own mobile phone, if only to use rideshare services like Grab and translate menus and signs with Google Translate. SIM cards are widely available at roadside stalls and phone service shops. Recent law changes means foreigners need to their passport to buy a SIM card; it will be photographed and registered in a database, but the vendor will fold a page over so your signature is not captured. A card alone should be just a few thousand; the smallest data package available to foreigners seems to be 6 GB for Rp 100,000.</p>
<p>International Direct Dialing prefix: 001, 007, or 008. (the three digits prefix means using non-internet phone, which the tariff is more expensive than the internet phone and sometimes up to 8x.)</p>

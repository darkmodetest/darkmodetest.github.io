<p>Acadia National Park is the only United States national park in New England and the easternmost national park on the mainland.  It is on the coast of the Down East region of Maine, near the town of Bar Harbor. </p>
<p>Acadia NP encompasses more than 47,000 acres (19,000 hectares), 30,300 of which are on Mount Desert Island.  2,728 acres of the park lie on Isle au Haut and 2,266 more on the Schoodic Peninsula in Winter Harbor.</p>
<p>Acadia is one of the smaller national parks in the country, yet it attracts around 4 million visitors per year. </p>
<p>It was designated as Sieur de Monts National Monument in 1916 by a presidential proclamation by Woodrow Wilson. Congress renamed the park Lafayette National Park in 1919.  Congress again enacted a name change in 1929 to the name we now use, Acadia National Park.  It was the first NP established east of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>In October 1947, Acadia and some adjacent lands were ravaged by fire.</p>
<p>A quick look at any topographical map of Mount Desert Island will indicate the powerful and lasting effects of the last ice age on the island and the current landscape of Acadia.  As the last glacier receded over 18,000 years ago it left behind the elongated mountains and lakes we see today.  The moving ice was also the culprit behind the "bald" summits of most of the park's hilltops, scraping off vegetation and leaving the beautiful pink granite underneath.</p>
<p>More than 273 bird species have been identified in the park, including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, blue jays, finches, and chickadees (the Maine state bird).  Mammal species include deer, squirrels, foxes, rabbits, porcupines and bats.  Other species include garter snakes, the American bullfrog, and the North American red-bellied salamander.</p>
<p>Acadia's weather is largely a product of latitude and marine influences. On a daily and annual basis, Mount Desert Island temperatures are more moderate than those of inland Maine. The Maine coastal climate has been ranked second only to the Pacific Northwest in annual precipitation. This moisture occurs in every form at Acadia. Ice storms are regular in winter and early spring, and rain is frequent in every month. Fog is common during June, July, and August.</p>
<p>Spring can be foggy with temperatures ranging between 30 °F (−1 °C) and 70 °F (21 °C). Wear light-colored clothing, long sleeve shirts, and long pants for protection. Annual rainfall is 48 in (1,200 mm).</p>
<p>Summer daytime temperatures range from 45 °F (7 °C) to 90 °F (32 °C). Evenings are cooler. Dressing in layers is advisable for any boating or hiking activities. Ocean water temperatures range from 50 °F (10 °C) to 60 °F (16 °C). Lake water temperatures range from 55 °F (13 °C) to 70 °F (21 °C).</p>
<p>Fall temperatures can range from low 70s during the day to freezing during the night. Come prepared for all types of weather, from sun to fog, from downpours to flurries. Fall foliage often peaks during the first couple of weeks in October. Weather conditions over the summer, such as drought, may alter the time that the leaves peak.</p>

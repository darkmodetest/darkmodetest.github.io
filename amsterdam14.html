Amsterdamse Bos also offers Fun Forest, a climbing trail between the trees, and the Bosmuseum about the forest, which is actually a lot of fun, especially if you're travelling with children. Both are near the main entrance in Amsterdam Zuid. Amsterdamse Bos is on the outskirts of the city, not far from Schiphol, partially  in Amstelveen and Oudekerk, and near Aalsmeer Nieuw Oosteinde.</p>
<p>Amsterdam also has three so-called city beaches in West, Oost and Zuid. The one in Oost, Blijburg, is the best of these, and you get the fine architecture and atmosphere of the IJburg neighbourhood included for free.</p>
<p>You can also watch a film at one of the more than 55 cinemas. Rialto in Zuid and Kriterion in Plantage run a selection of art house and alternative films, and Lab111 in West often shows cult movies. The EYE Film Institute in Noord is dedicated to film conservation, but also has screenings and exhibitions.</p>
<p>Football: AFC Ajax play soccer in Eredivisie, the Dutch top tier, and often win it. Their home ground is Johan Cruijff ArenA (capacity 54,000) 5 km south of the centre, metro station Bijlmer ArenA, which also hosts internationals. Their second-string team Jong Ajax (or "Ajax 2") plays in Eerste Divisie, the second tier, at Sportpark De Toekomst near the ArenA.</p>
<p>A canal cruise usually lasts from one to two hours. Commentary on the surroundings is given during the route. Departures from Prins Hendrikkade opposite Centraal Station, quayside Damrak, Rokin near Spui and Stadhouderskade 25 near Leidseplein. If it's a warm day, avoid the enclosed boats with glass ceilings—they get hot. You can also cruise the canals yourself with a pedal boat or rented boat.</p>
<p>On Saturdays and alternate Sundays you can tour the city centre by vintage tram. Tours begin and end in Dam Square by the Nieuwe Kerk, it is not possible to enter or leave the tram at any other point on the route. Tours run every 30 minutes from 11:00 to 17:00 and last for about 30 minutes. €10, €5 for children under 12 and non-miniature dogs. Due to the historic nature of the vehicles, the tour is not suitable for people with restricted mobility (no wheelchair space, steep steps to enter the car).</p>
<p>Amsterdam is a cultural haven with year-round festivals for every pocket.</p>

<p>Amsterdam has two universities, both offer summer courses and other short courses (with academic credits). It also has one venerable institute.</p>
<p>Many people will find it difficult to get a suitable job if they do not speak Dutch. However, hostels and hotels in Amsterdam may need bar staff, night porters etc., who speak English and other languages. There are also specialist websites for English and non-Dutch speakers looking to work in Amsterdam and they are often a good place to start.</p>
<p>Immigration matters are dealt with by the immigration service IND. Registration is done by both police and municipalities. Immigration policy is restrictive and deliberately bureaucratic, this is especially true for non-EU citizens.</p>

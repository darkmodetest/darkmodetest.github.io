<p>Take your car or backpack.  Yes, you can walk through the park on the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>Motorists should be aware that some roads close for several months out of the year due to snow and ice. Buses and large motorhomes are prohibited on some roads in the park. There are also temporary road closures due to weather and construction.</p>
<p>Refer to the park's website for all up to date conditions.</p>

<p>The park has many miles of hiking trails. There are occasional ranger-guided tours.</p>
<p>The visitor centers offer books and souvenirs pertaining to the park.  The Cable Mill store, in Cades Cove, offers the same, and grains ground in the on-site, water-powered, historic cable mill.  The main focus of the park is nature, not commerce, so don't expect huge selections of goods.</p>
<p>Autotouring is a nice way to see the park; however, gas is not sold in the park. There are gas stations in the surrounding cities.</p>
<p>Camp stores are expensive and have limited selection.  There might be a restaurant or two, but lines are long and prices high. Since the nearby tourist towns of Gatlinburg and Cherokee are very tourist oriented, they offer a variety of restaurants to suit any taste. Your best bet is to visit a grocery store and buy ready-to eat or picnic style food. Many places in the park offer great locations to pull off the road and have a meal in nature. There are also many designated picnic areas in the park, including Collins Creek and Chimney Tops along Highway 441 and Greenbrier and Cades Cove along Laurel Creek Road. Make sure to dispose of your trash and not to litter the park.</p>
<p>The consumption of alcoholic beverages, and the possession of opened containers, is banned in the park except in housing, lodging facilities, designated picnic areas, campgrounds, or as allowed by special permit.</p>
<p>Do not drink the water in streams without first boiling it; this water may contain diseases transmitted by the fecal material of animals.</p>
<p>If you insist on being within a short walk from your car, that'll set you back between $12 and $20 a night. There are 10 "car camping" campgrounds in the park. </p>
<p>These campgrounds have restrooms with cold running water and flush toilets. There are no showers or RV hookups in the park. Each campsite has a picnic table and "grill." No more than six people to a campsite with a maximum of two tents or one RV and one tent. You are limited to a seven day stay during the Summer and Fall, and fourteen days during Spring and Winter. Pets are allowed if they are properly restrained.</p>
<p>Bears and other wildlife frequent camp areas. Do not leave any food, or items associated with food, out unattended. Store it in a closed vehicle, not your tent.</p>
<p>Your best bet is to camp in the backcountry, but a permit (available at most ranger stations and visitor centers) is required.  Campers must stay in a park shelter or a designated camp site.  The shelters, as well as a number of tent areas, require reservations (865-436-1231).</p>

The station for long distance coach services is 50.861354.359936 Brussels North CCN in a narrow street to the north-west of the railway station bearing the same name. While waiting for a connecting coach, the 50.859984.359631 Starbucks inside the station can offer warmth and power sockets without the obligation to buy their overpriced drinks.</p>

<p>Brussels is the third capital on Eurovelo Route 5, which starts in London, through Brussels and Switzerland and ends in southern Italy. A number of other international and national cycle routes converge on Brussels, see this overview.</p>
<p>In short: try and use your car as little as possible. As with most European capitals, Brussels has taken great strides in eliminating cars, and with mostly good measures; as recently as the mid 2000s, Brussels had some of the worst (if not the worst) traffic jams in the western world, even rivalling cities like Los Angeles and New York City. Though Brussels is still lagging behind places like Amsterdam, the city's (overwhelmingly) left-wing government has installed bike lanes, pedestrianized streets, and invested in public transportation projects at a rate seldom seen in Europe. Though locals mostly approve of those measures, out-of-towners and people working in certain sectors have been more critical of the measures.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, it is strongly suggested not to drive near or within the R0. Most streets near the Grand Place have been pedestrianised, and only taxi and delivery drivers can access that area. However, the outskirts of Brussels (especially the southern region like Ukkel) are not always served by buses or trams, so having a car might be useful there.</p>

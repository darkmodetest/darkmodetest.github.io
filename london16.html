Lost items (if not destroyed) will end up at the Lost Property Office and will be stored for 3 months. You will need to fill in a form online describing your lost item and TfL will contact you if it is found. There is a charge for recovery of most items, however some items (e.g. Laptops) have higher fees.</p>

<p>London's iconic red Routemaster buses, which are recognised the world over, were withdrawn from regular service in 2005. Although a heritage service was continued on portions of two routes, this ceased in 2019. Routemasters are still used for tours and private parties.</p>
<p>Buses are generally quicker than taking the Tube for shorter (less than a couple of stops on the Tube) trips, and out of central London you're likely to be closer to a bus stop than a Tube station. Most buses in London are very frequent (at least every ten minutes) and are accessible for buggies and wheelchairs. Buses also have a flat rate fare which stays the same no matter how far you travel. You will need to pay the fare again if you board a different bus, although the Hopper fare allows you to take as many buses as you like in 62 minutes and only pay for the first one.</p>
<p>Over 5 million bus trips are made each weekday; with over 700 different bus routes you are never far from a bus. Each bus stop has a sign listing the routes that stop there and bus routes are identified by numbers and sometimes letters. Buses have very clear blinds on the front, with their route number and their destination. Transport for London produces all Bus route maps.</p>
<p>When you see your bus approaching, signal clearly to the driver that you intend to get on their bus: the way to do this is to stick your hand out, with an open palm. The driver will indicate and pull into the stop. Always wait for people to get off the bus before you enter.</p>
<p>Most buses have two doors. Form an orderly queue at the front door: when you reach the driver, touch your Oyster or contactless card on the reader or show them your Travelcard or pass (importantly, cash is not accepted). Some buses are worked by the "New Routemaster": you can get on this bus at any of its three doors, as long as you touch in your Oyster or contactless card as soon as you board. It should be noted that unlike the Tube, you are allowed to use an Oyster card which has zero (but not negative) or insufficient balance - this will cause the balance to be negative (the machines will flash an "Emergency fare charged" message which is the same as the normal fare); however, you must then recharge before the card can be used again.</p>

In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel, Australian servicemen and civilians which resulted in one death and several injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.</p>
<p>Postwar Brisbane had developed a "big country town" stigma, an image the city's politicians and marketers were very keen to remove but despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The State Government began a major program of change and urban renewal beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. Trams in Brisbane were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969 leaving Melbourne as the last Australian city to operate a tram network.</p>
<p>The 1974 Brisbane flood was a major disaster which temporarily crippled the city. During this era, Brisbane grew and modernised rapidly becoming a destination of interstate migration. Some of Brisbane's popular landmarks were lost sometimes demolished in controversial circumstances with much media coverage and public protest. Major public works included the Riverside Expressway, the Gateway Bridge and later the redevelopment of South Bank after the city hosted World Expo '88 starting with the Queensland Art Gallery and Performing Arts Centre.</p>
<p>In subsequent years there has been strong immigration into Brisbane and the surrounding region, both domestically and internationally with large influxes from Asia, the Europe, New Zealand and Polynesia. This was driven by cheaper house prices than in other Australian cities, a pleasant climate and good employment opportunities, especially within the mining and tourism sectors. Brisbane's population growth has exceeded the national average every year since 1990 at an average rate of around 2.2% per year.</p>
<p>Since 2000, Brisbane has gone from drought to flooding rains. In the mid-2000s, lower dam levels led to severe water restrictions for residents. The campaign to lower water usage was so successful that the city now boasts some of the lowest average water use per resident of any developed city in the world. These days you're not likely to find the tap dry or see any visible signs of the shortage. However out of respect for the locals, keep your showers relatively brief, try your best to conserve water and expect the locals to be horrified if you walk away from a running tap.</p>
<p>A number of extremely wet summers broke the drought and culminated in the January 2011 flood which devastated the city. In typical Queensland fashion, one of the largest volunteer workforces ever amassed: over 100,000 Brisbane locals and Queensland volunteers descended on the city to aid in the clean-up, earning the nickname the "Mud Army" and allowing the city to return to business just a week after the flood. The Mud Army were honoured with the naming of a new CityCat Ferry, the "Spirit of Brisbane" and then Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard described Brisbane residents as "the best of humankind", gifting a monument to the city to honour the volunteers.</p>

<p>Shopping hours in metro Melbourne are typically 7 days a week, 9AM–5:30PM weekdays and 9AM (maybe later)–5PM weekends. Most suburban shopping centres such as Chadstone have later closing hours on Thursdays and Fridays – mostly up to 9PM. Supermarkets have extended hours 7 days, the majority opening at 7AM and closing at midnight or 1AM; there are also many 24-hour supermarkets.</p>
<p>Alcohol in Victoria can be purchased at licensed shops/venues, and supermarkets often have an adjoining bottle shop that closes earlier than the supermarket. Some stock alcohol in the supermarket, if they close at the same time as their licence. You must be over 18 years old to purchase alcohol. Most bottleshops close by 10PM to midnight (even on weekends), but some open until 3AM (e.g. on Riversdale road in Booroondara and Russell St Melbourne), and 24-hour bottleshops on both Chapel and Lygon streets, in Stonnington and Melbourne respectively.</p>
<p>Melbourne is known as the fashion capital of Australia with numerous malls and boutique-lined streets.</p>
<p>In the CBD itself, Little Collins Street is home to some of the world's top designers and fashion houses; Collins Street also boasts other high end shops such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès. Brunswick Street (Fitzroy), and the southern end of Chapel Street in Prahran/Windsor, have clusters of stores selling an eclectic mix of vintage, rave, retro and alternative gear such as Shag, Fat Helen's and Beaut Vintage to shop around.</p>
<p>Melbourne Central is another shopping mall based in the city, adjacent to the underground station of the same name. The Bourke Street Mall with the department store David Jones, as well as the flagship store of Myer, Australia's largest department store chain, is another city-central shopping hub.</p>
<p>For the bargain shopper, there is a DFO Outlet Mall (Direct Factory Outlet) located on the Southbank, next to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre (MCEC), a short walk from Southern Cross Railway Station. There are also camping/military surplus stores on Elizabeth Street for backpacking essentials.</p>
<p>Bridge Road in Richmond is a strip where warehouse direct outlets rule and no-one pays recommended retail price.
Chapel Street in South Yarra is a favourite among the locals, with its spread of exclusive boutiques, cafes and well established chain stores.
There are also several huge shopping complexes in the outer suburbs, such as Chadstone and Southland (Cheltenham) in the South-East. Doncaster Shoppingtown, Eastland (Ringwood) and Knox City are in the outer East. Northland in the north, Highpoint in the west.</p>
<p>Melbourne is also home to many of Australia's largest shopping centres with hundreds of stores, including Chadstone Shopping Centre in Malvern East (the largest shopping centre in the Southern Hemisphere), Highpoint Shopping Centre in Maribyrnong, Knox City Shopping Centre in Wantirna South, and Fountain Gate Shopping Centre in Casey. </p>
<p>For those in the bridal market, High Street in Armadale, Stonnington and Sydney Road in Brunswick, Moreland are the two main clusters for  bridal apparel and accessories.
For those who are looking for local, aspiring designer creations, try Greville Street in South Yarra, Stonnington or Smith Street and surrounds,</p>

The oldest part of town can have uneven cobblestone roads, but the rest of the city is fairly easy to walk. A zone of 50 hectares in the city centre is reserved for pedestrians, the second largest in Europe after Venice. Brussels has many wet days, and in winter small amounts of snow can make the ground slushy, so water-resistant footwear is a must if you will be out walking all day.</p>
<p>Bicycles are an excellent way to get from the city center to attractions outside the 'pentagone'.  Although the Brussels weather isn't always equally favorable for cycling, bikes are often faster than public transport, particuarly for short distances. The cycling infrastructure is fairly poorly developed in comparison to cities of similar size like Amsterdam and Bristol, and the elevation of Brussels might be challenging to inexperienced cyclists. Brussels' most valuable transport asset is, arguably, the Villo bicycle-sharing system.</p>
<p>To encourage cycling through the city, cyclists are granted some privileges in Brussels traffic. Most notably, cyclists are allowed to drive either way in one-way streets. They are allowed to drive through the car-free zone in the city center, the largest in Europe after Venice. At intersections marked with a triangular sign with a cycle icon and a right arrow, cyclists are allowed to turn right at any time, ignoring red traffic lights.</p>
<p>Villo (a portmanteau of the French words ville - city - and vélo - bike) is Brussels' public bicycle sharing system. It consists of 5000 bicycles in the Brussels-Capital Region, making it one of the largest in the world, with an infrastructure of 360 stations. Cycles can be rented out in any station and returned to the same or any other station, making it a convenient solution for point-to-point travel (as opposed to the  NMBS BlueBike scheme which requires return to the same station, making it only suitable for round trip journeys).</p>
<p>Villo bicycles are well equipped to deal with the poor Belgian roads: they have puncture-resistant tires and a covered chain drive, and are in addition also equipped with a basket for cargo transport and automatic lights. Each bike has 7 gears and dual disc brakes to tackle hills around the city and reach destinations with higher elevation. The frame is rather heavy, though, weighing 22 kg. A decent level of fitness is recommended!</p>
<p>You can create an account online to sign up for a Villo subscription. They cost €1 per day or €3 per month for unlimited 30-minute rides. Villo subscriptions cost €4 per month (as of Sep 2022) and give you the option to get a battery pack that you plug into the Villo bikes and take with you when they're done. The batteries have a 10-km range and can be picked up from the Villo office immediately after subscribing. To checkout bikes with a subscription you can use the Villo app, link your mobib vard, or get a Villo card.</p>

Not only will they demand an obscene fee for the cheap trinkets (usually over €15), they will also try to pickpocket you or threaten you with force if you do not give them money. They are usually only at the base of the monument and can be avoided by taking the Funicular of Montmartre. Otherwise, you can quickly walk past them and ignore them, though they will readily grab people's arms and have even been known to target children of tourists. Yelling at them may cause unwanted attention and cause them to back off, but be careful. Sacré-Cœur appears to be the only area where they congregate, but they have been sighted also near the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>Besides them, you will notice many people walking around with cheap trinkets at touristy areas, especially the Trocadéro, Eiffel Tower, and Louvre Museum. They are generally not rude, but buying things from them is illegal and hurts small businesses. Of course, they bolt at the sight of the police, and you may end up in the middle of a stampede!</p>
<p>Be careful around Barbès-Rochechouart and the bars near Moulin Rouge. A very common clip joint trick is played here which might cost you up to €500. The agents standing outside will force you to enter a bar and just have a look for 5 minutes. The moment you order a drink (about €5), a girl will approach you and start talking generally, and leave in 10–15 minutes. After a harmless conversation with the girls when you request a bill, you will encounter a charge of say €200-500 as 'service fees' for the services rendered by the girl! In case you resist paying, the bouncers will start intimidating you to try to extract money from your wallet. In such cases, threaten them that you are calling the police and informing the local embassy. Try to buy some time and start creating a ruckus. However, do not try to start a fight with the bouncers. This trick is common to many European big cities.</p>
<p>One scam involves a "helpful" local buying a ticket for you. Normally, tourists buy 1-day, 3-day or longer Paris Visite passes. They would tell you that your single trip ticket has expired and bring you to the ticketing machine to purchase day passes. Then they would select the 3 day pass for adults (even though you may be a student) and deliberately show you the price on the screen. Everything else is in French so you would not understand a thing. They would proceed to purchase with a credit card and while entering the PIN code, get you to turn your back on them. They then sneakily change the ticket to a single trip ticket and ask for payment for a 3-day ticket from you. Unsuspecting tourists would pay the full sum thinking it is a 1-day or 3-day pass when it is only a useless ticket. Buy the tickets yourself to avoid situations like these, as machines are available in English and other languages. If you feel threatened, call the police and don't physically handle the ticket if they forcibly purchase without your agreement.</p>

To rent a Villo, a ticket can be purchased at a station. Not all stations issue tickets, which can be confusing. Tickets are available for 1 or 3 days, and permit an unlimited number of rides. With a cost of €1.60 per day, this makes Villo the cheapest method of transportation after walking. Week passes are also available at €7.65. As Villo is intended for short trips, you will be billed €0.50 per half hour after the first half hour (the first half hour being free). This is of course easily avoided by returning your bike to a station before the first half hour expires, and immediately renting another bike from the same station, resetting the counter.</p>
<p>Purchasing a ticket goes as follows:</p>
<p>When choosing a bike, look at the orientation of the saddles. The convention among users is that, if a bike is defective, the saddle is lowered and its direction reversed. So don't try to rent out bikes with a reversed saddle. Likewise, if you notice your bike has a defect, then return it to the station and reverse its saddle to notify other users. Unless there is obvious evidence of vandalism, minor damage (flat tires, broken chains, etc.) will not be billed to your account.</p>
<p>When returning your bike to a station, always wait for the double beep and green light on the post you returned the bike to. Long beeps indicate that the bike is not placed incorrectly. After the double beep, the bike should be locked again. If you don't return it correctly and the bike is stolen, €150 will be billed to your account!</p>
<p>After purchasing a ticket, bikes can be rented out from any station by typing the 6-digit subscriber number on the ticket into the station's kiosk, followed by the 4-digit 'password'.</p>
<p>Bikes that are complementary to Villo. Cost €12/year for a membership. Then €3.5 to checkout the bike for a day. You can have the bike for up to 24 hours for that cost. You can link Blue Bike with your MOBIB card or get a separate Blue Bike card.</p>
<p>Billy Bike is an electric bike option with an unlock fee of €1 and €0.17/min. Have several subscription plans for frequent users.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Rent bikes from Swapfiets for €20/month. They'll repair the bikes if they get broken.</p>
<p>Uber has a fleet of free floating electric bikes in Brussels. The operating area is mostly limited to the eastern part of the city. The rates are €1 to unlock and €0.15/minute.</p>
<p>Public transport in Brussels can be confusing because different transport companies are active in the city. The dominant operator is the Brussels regional public transport operator STIB-MIVB (+32 70 232-000; €0.30/min). Some buses from Flemish regional transport operator De Lijn connect Brussels to surrounding Flemish cities, but their tickets are not compatible with MIVB tickets. Occasionally even buses from the Walloon regional operator TEC venture into the city, and again, their tickets are incompatible.</p>

<p>Beijing (北京 Běijīng) is China's capital and its second-largest city after Shanghai, with a population of around 22 million. With a rich history as the capital of Imperial China for much of its past, Beijing became the political and cultural heart of the People's Republic of China following the Chinese revolutions.</p>
<p>The city is renowned for its flat terrain and orderly layout. Within the city limits, you'll find just three hills, all located in Jingshan Park, north of the famous Forbidden City. Beijing's urban structure is marked by its concentric "ring roads," which are actually rectangular in shape, mirroring the configuration of the Forbidden City.</p>
<p>Beijing is a city of contrasts, where the old meets the new, particularly within the 2nd and 3rd Ring Roads. Here, cutting-edge technologies and modern social innovations coexist with historical architecture and alleyways. While the people of Beijing may initially seem reserved, they are warm and engaging once you get to know them. As you explore Beijing, be mindful of customs and social norms that may differ from your own; see the China article for further insights. However, Beijing is home to sophisticated urbanites, so the cultural differences here may be less pronounced than in rural areas or other cities in China's interior.</p>
<p>Beijing has a total of 16 districts.</p>
<p>The two central districts are located within or just beyond the 2nd Ring Road.  This is the location of the old walled city of Beijing and is where you will find most of the sights and also a good deal of sleeping, eating and drinking and entertainment options.  The districts are:</p>

<p>The next four districts are also fairly close to the centre, and highly urbanized. They are often referred to as the inner suburbs. Here you will find universities, Olympic venues, business and embassy areas, entertainment and bars, art districts, and parts of the Western Hills. The districts are:</p>

<p>The remaining ten districts are far from the centre.</p>
<p>Beijing (formerly transliterated "Peking") literally means Northern Capital, a role it has played many times in China's long history. Beijing's history dates back several thousand years but it first became notable in Chinese history after it was made the capital of the State of Yan under the name Yanjing. Yan was one of the major kingdoms of the Warring States Period, some 2,000 years ago.  After the fall of Yan, during the later Han and Tang dynasties, the Beijing-area was a major prefecture of northern China.</p>
<p>In 938, Beijing was conquered by the Khitans and declared the capital of the Liao Dynasty. The Mongols seized the city in 1215. From 1264 Beijing served as the capital of a united China under Kublai Khan. His victorious Mongol forces renamed the city, Great Capital (大都). From there, Kublai and his descendants ruled their empire from a northern location closer to the Mongol homelands. During this period, the walled city was enlarged and many palaces and temples were built.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty in 1368, the capital was initially moved to Nanjing. However, in 1403 the 3rd Ming emperor, Zhu Di, also known as Emperor Yongle, moved it back to Beijing and gave the city its present name. The Ming period was Beijing's golden era. The Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven and many other Beijing landmarks were built in this period. The capital developed into a huge city becoming the religious and cultural center of Asia.</p>

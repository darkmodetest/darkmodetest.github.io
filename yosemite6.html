The cliffs rise around the valley at impossibly vertical angles, waterfalls tumble down unimpeded from a thousand feet (300 m) above, and the Merced River meanders aimlessly along the valley floor. The Valley is also one of the most accessible places in the park, with roads open year-round and plenty of amenities including lodging and food (but no gas stations). During summer months traffic can make the valley highly congested, so consider using the shuttle to cut down on stress.</p>
<p>Those entering the valley via Highway 41 will be treated to the spectacular viewpoint known as Tunnel View. Named for the tunnel that bores through the granite, the eastern side provides a dramatic view of Yosemite Valley with El Capitan on the left, Bridalveil Fall on the right and Half Dome in the center. Photographers should consider this area for pictures after storms, as many of the most famous pictures of the Valley have been taken from this spot as rough weather clears. There are two small parking lots that can get congested, so arrive early in the day if visiting during Summer to ensure a spot.</p>
<p>The sights in the valley include the granite monolith of Half Dome, a mountain that looks like it was split in two, leaving only a vertical face and rounded granite summit behind. In reality Half Dome was formed in the same way that many of Yosemite's granite formations were created - long ago an intrusion of magma deep underground solidified to form a massive granite block, and that block was eventually exposed to the surface via a combination of erosion and uplift. Glaciers that flowed through Yosemite did the rest, carving out the wide, U-shaped valleys that are bordered by sheer vertical walls. These same forces created the wall of El Capitan, a mecca for rock climbers and another of the Valley's famous formations.</p>
<p>Waterfalls in Yosemite Valley include Yosemite Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in the world at 2,425 ft (739 m). Bridalveil Fall is another easily accessible waterfall, while Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall can be reached by those willing to do some hiking. While some water flows over the waterfalls year-round, by mid-Summer flows are significantly diminished - plan on visiting in the Spring to see these waterfalls at their grandest.  Yosemite is one of two places in the US – the other is Cumberland Falls State Resort Park – where "moonbows", or faint nighttime rainbow produced by the moon's light, can be seen.  When the water is flowing and the moon is near the full, you may be able to see one, if you're in the right spot and have sharp eyes.  https://www.yosemitemoonbow.com/ has predicted days, times, and locations for these special moments.</p>
<p>Wawona is the home to the historic Wawona Hotel, dating from the late nineteenth century. The Pioneer Yosemite History Center, a collection of historic buildings, is just over the covered bridge from the hotel. Wawona is accessible by car year-round.</p>

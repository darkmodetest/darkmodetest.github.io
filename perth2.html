Summers are hot and dry, while winters are generally wet and mild. Summer temperatures average 30°C (86°F) between November and April. Maximum temperatures during the height of summer can reach and sometimes exceed the 40°C (104°F) mark. Very hot days tend to have very low humidity, making conditions more bearable. Sunrise is at 5:15AM and it does not get dark until around 7:15PM during the summer months.</p>
<p>In the Perth metropolitan area, the summertime temperature rises rapidly during the morning, relieved in the afternoon when the "Fremantle Doctor" blows inland from the ocean to cool the city by up to 15°C. The doctor runs out of puff before reaching the areas further inland, leaving the hills and beyond to swelter till after sunset.</p>
<p>Winter (Jun-Aug) temperatures are usually around 15°C in the day, and usually fall to about 8-10°C at night. Minimum temperatures have been known to drop below 0°C on clear nights. Though Perth goes through lengthy dry spells, when it does rain, it pours. In the past storms with strong winds occasionally hammer a winter night, but they generally caused no more destruction than a toppled tree or flattened fence. Intense storms have created hail and more serious damage. Snow has never been known to fall in the Perth city centre, though very light dustings have been known to occur on higher elevations in the Perth Hills. Daylight hours run from 7:15AM to 5:15PM during winter.</p>
<p>Spring (Sep-Nov) and Autumn (Mar-May) are ideal times in which to visit Perth.  Spring (particularly Oct/Nov) is perhaps the very best time, as after a decent winter's rainfall, the famous wild flowers around Kings Park and the neighbouring Avon Valley region are blooming. The metropolitan areas and the bushlands have many flowering species which often flower en-masse, so it is wise to purchase over-the-counter hay fever or antihistamines from a local chemist before making a trip to see them. Beach-goers from colder climes might find the summer months too harsh, so it is perhaps best to visit during March–April or October–November, and to take a hat, sun-screen lotion and sunglasses.</p>
<p>The local inhabitants tend to holiday during the height of summer or winter, either to escape the climate, or to celebrate it. In winter, Perth inhabitants often travel north to Broome or Bali for the warmth, or else stay in small chalets in the south and south west during the winter to enjoy the cool wet climate and seasonal foods.</p>
<p>Although Western Australia has many public holidays, they are unlikely to cause much inconvenience to your travels. Most shops are still open, public transport still runs (to a reduced timetable) and the sky is still blue. The exceptions are Good Friday, Anzac Day (25 Apr) and Christmas Day (25 Dec), when most shops and restaurants are closed.  Generally only offices, banks and government services are closed for the other 7 public holidays; New Year's Day (Jan 1), Australia Day (26 Jan), Good Friday, Easter Monday, Labour Day (first Monday of March), King's Birthday (last Monday in September), WA Day (first Monday in June) and Boxing Day (26 Dec).</p>

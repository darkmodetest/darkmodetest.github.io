Passenger counts are strictly enforced, and there is no effective queue meaning that missing one ferry is no guarantee you will get on the next. The main peak period is on sunny weekend afternoons returning from Parramatta and all pickup points along the river, and during the Vivid festival heading towards the city. School holidays and weekdays 4PM-6PM at Barangaroo heading to Parramatta can be busy too (you are okay if you board at Circular Quay where the ferry originates) as commuters, tourists, and day trippers compete to get home. Cockatoo Island is an awkward place to be stuck, so allow enough time to get the ferry the other way and back if you need to.</p>
<p>Captain Cook Ferries and Manly Fast Ferries also run ferry services complementing and competing with the government contracted Sydney Ferries. Manly Fast Ferries runs a service between Circular Quay and Manly. Captain Cook ferries run a Darling Harbour to Circular Quay, Barangaroo to Manly and services around the Harbour and to Harbour Islands. They also run a Zoo Express to Taronga Zoo wharf, with a combined entry pass the same price as the Sydney Ferries ferry. You'll get a nicer ferry and commentary on the way. They also run a Manly to Watsons Bay ferry that offers a significant time saving over the ferry via Circular Quay. You can tap your Opal Card or credit card to pay for the Manly Fast Ferry services, using a service called OpalPay, however you will not receive any of the frequent travel benefits.</p>
<p>Charter a boat on the Harbour to get you across the water. Lots of services are available around the Harbour, with self-drive boat hire, luxury boat hire and more. Around New Years Eve, and Australia day the Harbour is at its busiest so take care to organise ahead of time.</p>
<p>Taxis in Sydney are expensive and notorious for various scams and ripoffs, ranging from mysteriously broken meters to fictitious surcharges and scenic detours, but they can also be the only transport option available to some locations late at night when the trains and regular buses stop. It is almost always faster, cheaper and more convenient to use rideshare services instead.</p>
<p>There are numerous operators.  13cabs is the largest and offers an Uber-style app with tracking and fixed fares.  You can also hail cabs off the street: if the light is on, it is available for hire; if the light is off, the cab is occupied.  By law, taxi drivers have to take you where you want to go, regardless of your destination, but particularly at busy times like Friday evenings many will refuse rides in the "wrong" direction.</p>
<p>There are two meter rates: a day rate (rate 1) with a flag fall of $3.30, a distance rate of $1.99/km, a "waiting" rate of $0.85/min, and a booking fee of $2.50; and a night rate (rate 2 – applicable to journeys commenced between 10PM–6AM), which adds a 20% surcharge to the distance rate. You can check the rate your taxi is using by looking for a 1 or a 2 next to the current charge: if it is set to 2, it is using the night rate. The so called "waiting" rate is charged whenever the speed drops below 25 km/h. For trips in congested traffic, it is possible for large parts of the trip to be charged at the "waiting" rate. All Sydney taxis are metered and taxi drivers hailed at the kerb are supposed to charge the metered rate, with any charges for tolls added automatically during the journey.</p>

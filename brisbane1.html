<p>Brisbane is the state capital of Queensland. Large enough to be cosmopolitan yet small enough to be friendly and accessible, Brisbane is a 'garden metropolis', famous for its leafy, open spaces and the pleasant pace of life that unfolds between the zig-zags of its iconic river. Brisbane's year-round warm climate, spectacular scenery, pleasant locals and world-class facilities have been the drawcards for many domestic and international visitors, making Brisbane the fastest-growing city in Australia. Despite this rapid development, it maintains a youthful enthusiasm and is considered one of the more laid-back and forward-thinking cities in the country. </p>
<p>The Greater Brisbane region has a population of about 2.2 million people and is Australia's third-largest city.</p>
<p>Brisbane, colloquially known as Brissie (pronounced Briz-ee), gained international exposure through multiple international sporting events and political summits, including the upcoming 2032 Summer Olympics. It is also known as the main setting of the animated kids TV series Bluey.</p>
<p>For many thousands of years prior to British settlement, the Brisbane area was inhabited by the Turrbal and Jagera Aboriginal people. They knew the area that is now the central business district as Mian-jin, meaning "place shaped as a spike". The Australian English phrase "hard yakka" – meaning "hard work" – comes from the Jagera people, and is certainly what the British settlers faced in Brisbane's humid subtropical climate.</p>
<p>The Moreton Bay area was explored by English navigator Matthew Flinders. On 17 July 1799, Flinders landed at what is now known as Woody Point which he named "Red Cliff Point", now Redcliffe after the red-coloured cliffs visible from the bay. In 1823, Governor of New South Wales Sir Thomas Brisbane instructed that a new northern penal settlement be developed, intended to house dangerous prisoners in a remote location and an exploration party led by John Oxley further explored Moreton Bay. The original penal settlement was established in Redcliffe but was later moved to a location further down the bay where freshwater supplies were more reliable. Oxley named this new settlement "Brisbane" in honour of the Governor.</p>
<p>A series of major immigration events took place in the following decades which brought with it strong industry and commercial development in the region. In 1838, non-convict free settlers moved to the area and pushed to close the jail and to release the land in the area. In 1859, a gold rush led to the establishment of the colony of Queensland with Brisbane as its capital even though Brisbane was not incorporated as a city until 1902. In 1925, the Queensland State Parliament created the City of Brisbane Act that set up a single government for the city of Brisbane, still the largest metropolitan authority in Australia and one of the largest in the world by area. Over twenty small municipalities and shires were amalgamated to form the City of Brisbane. 1930 was a significant year for Brisbane with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance in ANZAC Square which has since become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940 are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city.</p>

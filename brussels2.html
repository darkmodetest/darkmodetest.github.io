Sunshine hours are generally low, but higher than in many other Northern European locations. Snowfall is possible, although heavy snowfalls with significant accumulation are not frequent and only occur periodically. In March and April the weather generally turns milder, alternating sometimes warm, sunny days with cooler, overcast days. May is often the locals’ favourite month, as it features frequent sunny days accompanied by the first periods of truly warm weather. June shares similar characteristics, but day temperatures by then surpass 20°C almost every day, with the exception of periods of rainy weather in which they can revolve around 17-19°C. July and August are warm, and heat waves have become more and more frequent, with temperatures over 35°C being surpassed virtually every year. It is advisable to check the weather before your visit, as you are equally as likely to encounter a sunny week with day temperatures over 30°C every day as a more variable week with frequent rain and day temperatures below 24°C every day. September can either feature Indian summer conditions with warm, sunny days, or entire rainy periods with mildly cool weather. October is mild, although temperatures drop off quite quickly and sunny days start becoming rarer after October. In December 2017, Brussels shattered the European record for the least amount of sunshine in any given month.</p>
<p>Brussels has as many indoor as outdoor activities to offer, so even if it turns out to rain every day of your visit, you'll find more than enough to do to make the visit worthwhile. The Buienradar (literally Shower Radar) shows the real time location of rain clouds and calculates predictions of their movements. The radar can tell when it will start to rain at your position with a 10-minute accuracy, and is a great tool for planning out your day.</p>
<p>Although Brussels is best explored by foot or by bike, the public transport network is the best option when it's raining. Museums and other attractions are rarely more than 10 minutes walking away from a metro station, so a map of the metro network in combination with the Buienradar can keep you dry through adequate planning. If you're caught by surprise, metro stations are excellent places to seek shelter from the rain, and the larger stations have facilities where you can purchase a hot beverage while waiting (De Brouckere, Central Station, Montgomery, and so on). Chains like Starbucks, Panos, McDonalds and the likes don't care if you occupy a table without making a purchase, so these are good options to sit out longer showers.</p>
<p>Brussels is split into 19 communes or gemeenten (municipalities/boroughs):</p>
<p>Language in Brussels can be a confusing matter to visitors. The common language is French, with around 90% of the population in Brussels speaking it passably to fluently. You can easily get by with English, especially in the tourist areas. Dutch is also an official language:  within Brussels, the population that speaks Dutch passably to fluently is limited to around 20%, though Dutch-speakers make up the majority of Belgium as a whole. Because Brussels is the country's capital, when it comes to official matters, French and Dutch have equal status in Brussels, with sometimes complicated rules to ensure a balance between the two. Streets, railway stations, bus stops and other places have names in the two languages. The two names don’t always sound or look similar. For example, the Brussels-South railway station is Bruxelles-Midi in French and Brussel-Zuid in Dutch. Watch out when making assumptions based on English: a common mistake is to think Bruxelles-Midi refers to the Brussels-Central railway station, due to midi seeming similar to middle. Areas outside of Brussels have only one official language, but may still have distinct names in the other language. For example, you may get a train ticket that lists Anvers (in French) as the destination, but the signs in the station there will only say Antwerpen (in Dutch). In Brussels, large segments of the population have neither French nor Dutch as their mother tongue, and many other languages can be heard on the street, with Arabic being particularly common.</p>

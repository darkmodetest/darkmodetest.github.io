The most renowned vegetarian restaurant is King's Joy (京兆尹), a fine dining experience of vegetarian dishes made with green, seasonal produce sourced from local organic farms. The restaurant is located at Wudaoying Hutong in the Dongcheng District. A budget veggie option with rave reviews is the 廷香小馆 (Lotus Restaurant), which is located in a hard to find building south of Sanlitun in Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>Tea, tea, and more tea! Beijing offers a variety of tea experiences, from simple shops in malls to stand-alone establishments. Whether you're in a bustling commercial center or a quieter neighborhood, always ask the price before ordering, or you might end up paying a premium for what could be the most expensive egg-sized cup of tea in the world. In particular, the Qianmen area south of Tiananmen Square is known for its tea houses, where you can experience different styles of tea ceremonies and tastings. However, be mindful that the quality and price can vary significantly. Some tea houses are genuine cultural experiences, while others are little more than tourist traps designed to milk you of your money (see the warning below about tea tasting scams).</p>
<p>There are teahouses around the historic Qianhai Hutong, offering a serene ambiance reminiscent of old wooden houses, with tea cups and bowls adorning the interior. You can enjoy a wide variety of teas, though be prepared for some steep prices—some teas can cost CNY200 or more. Ideal for couples and families.</p>
<p>Excellent coffee can be found in independent cafés scattered throughout the city.</p>
<p>Within the Second Ring Road in central Beijing, you'll find numerous hutong cafés tucked away in the alleyways. A notable area in the Dongcheng District is Dongsi North Road, a wide street lined with cafés. If you venture into the alleys branching off from the main road, you’ll discover hidden gems for coffee. As you walk north toward the Second Ring Road, you’ll come across Wudaoying Hutong, a long and narrow pedestrian street filled with small cafés dedicated to high-quality coffee, alongside trendy shops and restaurants. It's also the most relaxed pedestrian street in Beijing.</p>
<p>For a more scenic coffee experience, visit the hutongs surrounding Miaoying Temple in the Xicheng District. These cafés often have rooftop terraces offering stunning views of the 13th-century pagoda designed by a Nepalese architect. Strolling or circumabulating around the temple and through the winding hutong neighborhood paths, you’ll stumble upon charming spots for a coffee or a beer.</p>
<p>Baijiu (白酒 báijiǔ) is the quintessential Chinese spirit, typically distilled from grains such as sorghum. While there are many affordable options available, Maotai (茅台 Máotái) is considered the national liquor and is highly regarded. Prices for Maotai start at around ¥1,500. For a premium selection, visit the Maotai store at the Westin Beijing Financial Street, facing Wudinghou Street on the first floor. The store offers an extensive variety of Maotai, including the rare 6-liter Methuselah bottle of Maotai, priced at ¥48,800. Another top-tier baijiu is Wuliangye (五粮液), priced around ¥1,000, known for its smoother taste that might be more approachable for newcomers. For a taste of the typical swill, there is Erguotou (二锅头 Èrguōtóu), a strong and inexpensive baijiu, can be found at any convenience store in 500ml bottles with the red star brand.</p>

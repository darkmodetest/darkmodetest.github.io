Also within the complex is a permanent exposition, Discovery of India, which attempts to cover every aspect of artistic, intellectual and philosophical attainment of India through ages. The exposition spreads across 14 galleries and reflects true identity of the country. On the other end of the complex, Nehru Science Centre - which has a separate entrance from Mahalaxmi race course road, has a permanent exhibition on 'interactive and exciting' science related exhibits highlighting science principles in fun yet educational way.</p>
<p>Mumbai isn't known for beaches because they have immensely filthy water! Mumbai has a few beaches, including one in the southern districts. But they aren't that great and the water off Mumbai's coast is extraordinarily dirty. The relatively better ones are in North Mumbai. However, they are a great place to see how the locals spend their Sunday evenings, with various food and game stalls.</p>
<p>There are other beaches to be found such as the Girgaon Chowpatty (the cleanest one) in South Mumbai, Juhu Beach in the Western Suburbs and Aksa Beach in North Mumbai. The currents don't seem strong, but particularly in the rains, lots of people die from drowning, so avoid getting in the water (especially at Aksa Beach). A word of advice to women: Mumbai beaches are not the kind you can wear swimsuits to, particularly two-pieces.</p>
<p>Mumbai has a justified reputation as a concrete jungle, but there are some nice pockets of greenery within the city. It is also one of the rare megacities to have an entire national park within its borders (Sanjay Gandhi National Park[dead link]). You will not visit Mumbai for them, but if you are already here, they make a nice escape from the din and bustle. It also houses the ancient Kanheri Caves crafted out of rocky cliffs, which dates back 2,400 years.</p>
<p>The city zoo (Jijamata Udyan) in Byculla is a colonial relic and it is surprisingly well-preserved. The animals may look rather emaciated, but the sheer diversity of trees on this lush zoo is worth a trip.</p>
<p>Some city parks are very well-maintained and combine history as well. The "Hanging Gardens" on Malabar Hill offers stunning vistas of the Marine Drive. Opposite the Hanging Gardens, there is another park which is known as Kamla Nehru Park, famous for the striking shoe-shaped structure which has been filmed in various Bollywood movies</p>
<p>Further in South Mumbai, the Mumbai Port Trust Garden, is another hidden gem. This is set off a small side street off the Colaba Causeway 2–3 km (1.2–1.9 mi) south of the main section. Attractive views of the port, the naval yards and sunset.</p>
<p>In North Central Mumbai, there is Mancherji Joshi Five Gardens. Mainly used by walkers in the morning, it is a mess in the evenings. But the gardens encircle some historic, art deco residences.</p>
<p>Mumbai is probably worth visiting just for its street markets, the hustle of vendors, and the madness of the crowds.
Good places are Bandra, Khar and Andheri. If you came to Mumbai and didn't give visit to the highly dense and crowded markets, it means you didn't meet the real Mumbai.</p>

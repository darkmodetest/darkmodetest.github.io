The lockers say that you will have to retrieve your bags within 72 hours or else they will be removed, but they are actually moved to the room next door and stored until you retrieve them. This is a useful facility for people wanting to stow away big suitcases somewhere safe. The rate is €10 per 24 hours for up to 3 pieces, payments by card only. </p>
<p>50.46934.47042  Brussels South Charleroi Airport (CRL IATA) (42 km (26 mi) south of Brussels). Several budget airlines, including Ryanair and Wizzair operate service from this airport to cities such as Barcelona, Budapest, Copenhagen, Dublin, Edinburgh, Madrid, Manchester, Rome, Sofia, Warsaw, and nearly everything in between.

<p>High speed rail and the central location of Brussels amid many major European cities make it entirely feasible to fly into several other airports and take the train from there. Depending on your itinerary, this may be both faster and cheaper, as connections may align better.</p>
<p>Brussels has three main railway stations:</p>
<p>All three major stations in Brussels are very busy and there are trains departing in many directions almost every minute. If you are on the platform, do check if the train you are boarding is the one you want, as it may be the one that departs just a few minutes earlier. Be vigilant for last-minute platform changes. As the announcements for many trains (except for major international services and trains to Brussels Airport) are made in French and Dutch only, it is worthwhile to pay attention to departure displays. Always memorize the name of your destination in both French and Dutch to easily recognize it - the name as you may know it in English might not be used at all. Also note some trains are short, so at stations with long curved platforms such as at Brussel-Centraal (Bruxelles-Central) you may not be able to see the train if you’re standing on the opposite end of the platform.</p>
<p>Apart from the three above, there are also stations of Brussels-Schuman, Brussels-Luxembourg, Brussels-Congress, Brussels-Chapel and Brussels-West, as well as stations in municipalities of the Brussels region that do not have "Brussels" in their name (e.g. Schaerbeek, Evere) which only see limited local service by RER trains.</p>
<p>International train services to Belgium include:</p>
<p>Belgium has one of the most dense and best developed railway networks in Europe. Domestic trains are operated by the national railway operator  NMBS/SNCB[dead link] (hotline: +32 2 528-2828). Besides simple one-way tickets there is a bewildering variety of tickets available depending on the exact route (returns are cheaper, there are also "all Belgium" tickets), frequency, your age and occupation (students get discounts) and departure time (travel after 09:00 and on weekends is usually cheaper).</p>
<p>Frequencies and approximate travel times from Brussels-Central station to selected cities in Belgium:</p>
<p>There is also a fairly new suburban rail system (Brussels Regional Express Network, in French Réseau express régional (RER) and in Dutch Gewestelijk ExpresNet (GEN), or S train) that is like an S-Bahn, which serves nearby communities. Depending on the station, it can be faster or slower than an Intercity (IC) train, but as it is run by the national rail operator the price will be the same (fares are charged on the basis of distance for the most part). It will show up with the other trains when looking for tickets on the website, so you can see is it is a good fit for your journey or not.</p>

The Leidsestraat Apotheek in the Leidsestraat is open daily until 11pm. Remember to take medications with you. Some basic OTC drugs can be bought e.g. in Kruidvat[dead link] (convenience drugstore) and Albert Heijn[dead link] (supermarket).</p>
<p>The first Internet cafes in the country opened in Amsterdam, but they vanished as quickly as they appeared. Only a few smaller Internet cafes remain in the Binnenstad. Outside of it, you might want to try your luck at one of the phone shops (belwinkels) that cater to immigrant communities, but they usually have only one or two terminals.</p>
<p>Free Wi-Fi is provided at OBA public libraries and municipal district offices. Library workstations are available for a fee (or for free with an OBA card).</p>
<p>If you bring a laptop, many hotels in the city offer Wi-Fi for guests, but check in advance as some places still charge high fees, while cheaper hotels and hostels may have no Internet service at all. Several fast food chain restaurants and an ever increasing number of cafés and restaurants offer free Wi-Fi for guests, although you are typically expected to order a drink. Shops like Albert Heijn supermarkets also provide Wi-Fi service. Speed and stability obviously differ per place.</p>
<p>4G is fully available and several providers (including KPN, Vodafone and T-Mobile) have wide 5G coverage in Amsterdam. Other providers are expanding their coverage fast. Be advised that you could incur steep data charges when roaming on a non-EU cellular plan.</p>
<p>The country code for the Netherlands is 31 and Amsterdam's area code is 020. You only need to dial the 0 if you're calling from within the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Pay phones are increasingly rare as most people have a mobile phone. That's why pay phones mostly cater to tourists and can be found around tourist areas. Centraal Station has pay phones in groups of six near the main entrance. If making local calls from a pay phone, you may need a phone card (€5 minimum) as many green KPN telephone booths do not accept coins. Phone cards can be bought at post offices and some delis, although the cards are increasingly hard to find. The KPN booths are being replaced by newer models that will accept coins again. Blue/orange Telfort booths accept both coins and cards.</p>
<p>If you need to make a call and do not have access to a pay phone, local phone or hotel phone, it is best to go to a phone shop (belwinkel). Phone shops can be found all over the city. Outside the city centre, they mostly serve immigrants calling their home country at cheap rates. You can also use a calling service over the Internet like Skype.</p>
<p>If you have a simlock-free European GSM mobile phone (suitable for GSM 900/1800 networks), consider buying a prepaid simcard. You can buy these in any electronics store, and they are often the same price as buying a KPN phone booth card. Calling then is a lot cheaper than using pay phones, and you are mobile.</p>

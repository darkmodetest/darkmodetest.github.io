<p>The Grand Canyon is in northern Arizona, and is one of the great tourist attractions in the United States as well as one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The massive canyon encompasses several distinct areas, most famous of which is Grand Canyon National Park, a national park and a  UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors to the national park have many options, including: the remote North Rim; the more accessible (and therefore more crowded) South Rim; parts of the canyon, such as Phantom Ranch or the Colorado River, upon which many boating trips are made. In addition, parts of the southwestern end of the canyon are within the borders of two Indian reservations: the Havasupai Indian Reservation and the Hualapai Indian Reservation (which includes the development known as Grand Canyon West). Lastly, part of the southeastern end of the canyon is within the borders of the Navajo Nation. Except for the Navajo Nation portion, all sections of the canyon offer amenities for visitors. However, the national park, and in particular the South Rim, is by far the most popular destination and the best equipped to handle the millions of yearly visitors.</p>
<p>—Theodore Roosevelt</p>
<p>The canyon is an overwhelming experience, and nothing can prepare a visitor for the sight.  The Grand Canyon is a massive canyon carved over several million years by the Colorado River. Grand Canyon National Park boasts an elevation change of nearly 7,000 feet (2,130 m) from Point Imperial (at nearly 9,000 feet (2,740 m)) to the banks of Lake Mead (at just over 2,000 feet (610 m)). The canyon is over a mile (1610 m) deep, from rim to river. In spots the rock layers exposed in the canyon display over two billion years of geologic history.</p>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park was founded as Grand Canyon National Monument in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt, and became a national park in 1919.  Today the park contains over 1.2 million acres (490,000 ha; 4,900 km2), slightly less than the entire state of Delaware, and in 2018 received about 6.4 million visitors.</p>
<p>Throughout the past century, hundreds of authors have attempted to depict the enormous landscape that is Grand Canyon.  Not surprisingly, words most often fail to invoke the sense of awe and wonder that many visitors experience.  Edward Abbey, a noted Southwest author, once penned:  "Those who love it call it the canyon.  The canyon.  As if there were no other topographic feature on the face of the Earth".</p>
<p>There are, of course, other canyons on the planet.  Some are longer, others wider, and there are even some that are deeper.  Canyon visitors are often surprised to learn that Grand Canyon sets no records for sheer size.  It is, however, simply regarded by most as the "grandest" canyon of them all.</p>
<p>Geologically, the canyon extends from Lees Ferry near the city of Page and the Arizona/Utah border to the Grand Wash Cliffs near Las Vegas, a distance of 277 mi (446 km).  It ranges in width from about a quarter mile to over 18 mi (29 km) wide.  In places the canyon is over a mile (1.6 km) deep.</p>

<p>In Bininj/Mungguy culture it is important to listen carefully and consider the response carefully before giving an answer.</p>
<p>It is polite to say goodbye when leaving. The Bininj/Mungguy word for goodbye is Boh Boh (pronounced bor bor).</p>
<p>In Bininj/Mungguy culture it is often not appropriate to use the names or display images of deceased people.</p>
<p>Areas in Kakadu may close at short notice for cultural purposes at the request of traditional owners.</p>
<p>Walking is a great way to experience Kakadu. There are many walks throughout the park, including a wide variety of short and easy day walks as well as some longer, more challenging full day walks for those who are fit. Check seasonal access.</p>
<p>A permit is required for overnight bushwalks. Planning is essential, as is the ability to navigate using a topographic map and a compass. The routes are unmarked, and extend through remote and rugged country with variable climatic conditions.</p>
<p>A small, private cruise on the Corroboree or Yellow Water Billabongs is the best way to get a very close, safe and eco-friendly look at the biggest crocodiles in the world. Most tours include an activity like this. Shady Camp, near Corroboree, is home to one of the biggest crocodiles in the park at 6 meters in length.</p>
<p>Boating on Kakadu’s waterways can be dangerous due to strong currents, sand bars, submerged logs and crocodiles. For this reason use of non-motorised vessels (canoes) is prohibited.</p>
<p>Photography in the park might seem like a nice thing to do, particularly something you might want to take home, however, Australian law states that images and film captured in a Commonwealth reserve cannot be used to derive commercial gain unless at least one of the exemptions listed here in section 12.06 of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 with examples of exemptions include capture and use of images and film as allowed by the management plan for the Commonwealth reserve, and requesting and being granted a permit.</p>
<p>Kakadu Air has a range of scenic flights from different locations. It's particularly a useful way of seeing the waterfalls during the wet season (summer), as many of them are inaccessible.</p>
<p>Kakadu is an almost completely unpopulated landscape the size of a small country. There are, however, regular service stations, camping grounds, and outposts along the way with assorted small gifts as well as Aboriginal goods.</p>
<p>In Jabiru there is a service station, supermarket, newsagent and post office (Commonwealth Bank agency), Westpac Bank, travel agent, medical centre and chemist (☏ +61 8 8979 2018), police, public telephones, swimming pool, library (internet), hairdresser, golf course, restaurant, café and bakery.</p>
<p>Jabiru has a supermarket where you will find all the basic necessities. There are also a few nice little restaurants and cafes.</p>
<p>Basic food is available at the sporadic rest stops and museums throughout the park.</p>
<p>The lodge at Cooinda serves food until about 9PM and drinks later (whenever things slow down, it seems). The food is really good and includes dishes like the wild goose and kangaroo pie, but neither it or the drinks are cheap.</p>

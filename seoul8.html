While all younger Koreans are required to study English in school, due to a lack of practice, proficiency is generally poor, and most residents of Seoul only know a few simple words and phrases. If lost, a useful tip is to write down your question in simple words and show it to someone young. While it is possible to get by using only English, a basic grasp of Korean will make your trip much smoother.</p>
<p>While Seoul today is mostly known as a super-modern mega-city that is home to skyscrapers, malls, and millions of electronic-mad Koreans, the city contains over 2,000 years of history. The city contains 4 UNESCO sites marking important monuments from its 505 years as the capital of the Joseon Dynasty. Originally a walled city with 20 ft (6.1 m) stone walls and narrow lanes inside. Though many buildings were destroyed or damaged during the violent events of the first half of the 20th century, much of its historic core remains. So, anyone staying in Seoul should visit the many historical treasures the city has to offer, including the many palaces and city gates within the Jongno district.</p>
<p>Seoul has been a capital of Korea since the Joseon Dynasty. Starting from the Gyeongbokgung, many palaces were built for kings and royal family. The most important of them are called Five Grand Palaces (5대궁). Gyeongbokgung Palace is the grandest and most important palace, and is also the site of the Joseon Palace Museum and Korean Folk Museum. The main gate of the palace, Gwanghwamun, and its plaza are the center of Seoul. Changdeokgung, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, was the most favored residential palace of the Joseon Royal Family. It also has the beautiful garden named Secret Garden (Also was called 'Forbidden Garden'). Changgyeonggung and Gyeonghuigung are less famous due to extensive damage sustained after the fall of the Joseon Dynasty; Changgyeonggung was once a zoo, and Gyeonghuigung was once a high school. Finally, Deoksugung was used during the last years of the monarchy. It has a harmony of both traditional and western building design. All of these palaces have a thicker, more informative pamphlet for ₩500, which is worth the cost. </p>
<p>There are several traditional spots in Seoul besides palaces. Jongmyo Shrine is where the kings of the Joseon Dynasty are enshrined, and the Jongmyo Jerye ceremony, in which descendants of the Joseon royal family honor their ancestors, is held here every year. Jogyesa Temple and Bongeunsa Temple are notable Buddhist temples for experiencing Korean Buddhism.</p>
<p>Seoul is full of parks. Along the Han River (Hangang, 한강), there are Hangang Citizen's Park. It is in many districts, and each have a distinct spots. You can cycle along the river or buy a snack or souvenir at the night market. Among those, Banpo Hangang Park is most famous. You can see the fountain on the Banpo bridge, go to Some Sevit (an artificial floating island), or exercise at the Seorae island.</p>

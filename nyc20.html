The Film Society at Lincoln Center in the Upper West Side puts on a terrific repertory program and shows a wide variety of experimental and foreign films, and also hosts the prestigious New York Film Festival in October. Another major film festival is the Tribeca Film Festival, held each May and a prominent event in New York's film calendar. The Museum of the Moving Image in Long Island City in Queens puts on a terrific screening program, with films showing continuously throughout the day, while MoMa in Midtown Manhattan puts on a terrific repertory program (and compared to other New York movie theaters, tickets to films at MoMA are a steal).</p>
<p>Virtually every major national television network has studios in Manhattan, particularly the Midtown area, and many well-known programs are open to viewers. Rockefeller Center is home to NBC Studios and its flagship shows, including Saturday Night Live and Today, and is open for tours. Lincoln Square boasts programming produced for ABC, such as The View and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, at the network's West 66th Street facility. More examples of popular programs you can see in person can be found on the Manhattan page.</p>
<p>New York City hosts many parades, street festivals and outdoor pageants. The following are the most famous:</p>
<p>The Labor Day Carnival, or West Indian Carnival, is an annual celebration held in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Its main event is the West Indian-American Day Parade, which attracts between one and three million spectators, who watch the parade on its route along Eastern Parkway.</p>
<p>A number of professional and collegiate teams play in the New York metropolitan area.</p>
<p>New York City has a number of learning opportunities. </p>
<p>Columbia University, a member of the Ivy League, is, without a doubt, the most prestigious university in the city. It is adjacent to and affiliated with Barnard College, a top women's school. New York University (NYU) is also highly selective. Another notable university is Rockefeller University, a graduate-only school at which several significant biomedical discoveries were made. And the city also has its very own system of public colleges, City University of New York, with every borough represented among its numerous branches.</p>
<p>It is not a lie: New York City is one of the world's most expensive cities. One survey revealed that the city is the most expensive city in the world for expatriate workers. </p>
<p>That being said, there are ways to limit the damage; food is available from many halal food trucks for $7-10, which will get you rice with meat, vegetables and a soft drink, and you can still find inexpensive pizza slices at many of the hole-in-the-wall pizzerias throughout the city. Supermarkets and convenience stores generally also sell basic items at reasonable prices (by Western standards). New York's public bathroom infrastructure is lacking, so buying an item at a facility with a bathroom is generally advisable if you are far from your accommodation.</p>

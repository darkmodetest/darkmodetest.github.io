<p>Bus services within Victoria are operated by V/Line and operate from most major and many minor Victorian towns.</p>
<p>Melbourne is served by several international cruise ships throughout the year, particularly in the summer cruise season.</p>
<p>The Spirit of Tasmania used to depart and arrive at Melbourne from Devonport in northern Tasmania, but since October 23, 2022, the Spirit of Tasmania terminal was relocated to Geelong.</p>
<p>All passenger ships serving Melbourne arrive at and depart from Station Pier in Port Melbourne, about 5 km from the city centre. Tram route 109 (towards Box Hill) departs frequently from the old railway station across the road from the Pier, travelling into the heart of Melbourne along Collins St. You can purchase mykis from the vending machine at the tram stop, or from a visitor desk in the peak season.</p>
<p>Melbourne has a very large metropolitan area, but most sights of interest are within the city centre, and most of the rest can be reached within about 20 minutes on the train or tram. Melbourne's city centre is laid out in an orderly grid system, similar to the grid system of Manhattan, meaning that navigating the city centre is easy.</p>
<p>Melbourne has a comprehensive public transportation system consisting of trams, trains and buses: trams criss-cross the city to the inner suburbs and attractions, trains branch out from the city centre to the suburbs, and buses usually cover outer suburbs and suburbs between. There are connections to all major attractions of the city, and within the city centre and surrounds it is easier to get around without a car. Most of the train and bus network is wheelchair and pram accessible.  Trams are only accessible via a low floor tram at accessible stops - mostly in the city centre and St Kilda.  The accessible services and stops are indicated on the PTV website. Train, tram and major bus services generally operate between 5AM and midnight Monday–Saturday and after 8AM Sunday. On Friday and Saturday nights, all-night train, tram and bus services run on a limited night network.</p>
<p>Public Transport Victoria coordinates public transport and provides timetables, maps, disruption info and a very useful journey planner. Mobile apps are available for iOS and Android devices; Google and Apple Maps also integrate train, tram and bus information, although they are not as extensive as the PTV app. The PTV app is useful to find out about potential delays and planned changes to timetables.</p>
<p>Myki is a smart card used for fare payments on all trains, trams and buses. Myki cards can be purchased and reloaded at staffed railway stations, machines at railway stations and major tram stops, the airport, online and various retail stores such as newsagents and 7-Elevens. You cannot purchase or reload Myki cards on trains, trams or buses. Mobile Myki is available using Google Pay on Android smartphones. Fare payments cannot be made using a contactless credit or debit card but an upgrade to do so is underway as of 2025. </p>

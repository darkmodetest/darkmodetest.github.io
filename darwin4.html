<p>Start at Smith Street Mall in the city centre then branch out into the surrounding streets. Travellers will find a range of shopping experiences including local galleries specialising in Aboriginal art or speciality shops selling world-class pearls and crocodile-skin products.</p>
<p>Darwin’s downtown dining hub encompasses Mitchell and Knuckey Streets and is brimming with restaurants, cafes and pubs. Dinner in Darwin can be classy or casual, but always relaxed. For breakfast, Café Uno serves a tasty toasted avocado, tomato and cheese croissant, and coffee lovers should head to Café 21 in the mall. For something a little different, try the coconut loaf with lemon curd at Roma Bar or French toast with maple syrup and bacon at Ducks Nuts Bar and Grill.</p>
<p>Lunch options in the Central Business District are endless. Jump on the sushi train at Go Sushi, people-watch over a Caesar salad at Wisdom Bar & Café or try the crispy roast duck at Roast and Noodle. Enjoy Yum Cha at Tasty House, sample the variety of Tapas at Moorish Café or create your own stir-fry at Magic Wok. There is an array of pubs that serve up fish and chips, burgers and parmas, try Kitty O’Shea’s, Shennanigans or the Fox Ale House. For a juicy steak and fine wine visit Char Restaurant @ Admiralty, head to Hanuman for consistently great curry, get your Italian from Giuseppe’s or try mod oz fare matched with a colourful cocktail at Monsoons.</p>
<p>Stokes Hill Wharf Watch the barges, sail boats and tinnies out on the harbour or peer over the edge to see moon fish getting their feed from chips dropped by diners. Most of the food served here is picnic style take away. Stir-fried noodles, beer battered barramundi, crumbed calamari and other choices are presented on plastic plates. Make sure you visit the ice cream shop and refresh your palate with a scoop of butterscotch or mint choc chip. There is also a more upmarket seafood restaurant on site.</p>
<p>Well known for its markets, but also has a diversity of lesser-known restaurants. Try sizzling Mongolian beef at The Happy Garden Chinese Restaurant or steaming hot tamales from Prickles then move on to coffee and cake at The Cyclone Café or Paraparazzi. If you want to stock up on gourmet goodies, head to Parap Fine Foods, they’ve got a great deli and stock French home-style bread.</p>
<p>Best known for its views and pricey real estate, the assortment of dining in Fannie Bay is considerably less expensive than the housing. You can drink a glass of sparkling with breakfast at Cornucopia Museum Café, but be sure to book, as it is always busy. Across the road is the Darwin Ski Club, where the food is pub-style with harbour views. Try The Cool Spot Cafe, a trendy hangout that offers great light meals and snacks. The seafood dishes are a highlight at Pee Wee’s at The Point, especially the soft shell mud crab.</p>
<p>Offers an abundance of seafood choices and expansive harbour views, but you’ll also find Italian, Thai, Greek and French cuisine. Freshly shucked oysters are a specialty at Yots Greek Taverna, try the barramundi at La Beach, succulent battered bug tails from the takeaway fish and chip shop or settle with a glass of sparkling at Buzz Café. There is a large variety of restaurants along the boardwalk overlooking the marina, so you won’t be starved for choice.</p>

Taxis are available at the main entrance off Alameda Street and the station is within short walking distance to the Civic Center and Olvera Street. Chinatown and Little Tokyo are also nearby. Be warned that it can get uncomfortable in the station especially when it is hot and/or there are a lot of people. Free guided tours of Union Station are available on the 2nd Sunday of each month. No reservations are required; tours begin at 10:30AM at the information booth inside the Alameda Street entrance.</p>
<p>Union Station is the region's primary train station and has the best public transit connections, but there are several other Amtrak stops within the region that may be better located to your destination, namely in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and the San Fernando Valley. L.A. is massive, so make sure you get the right stop.</p>
<p> Amtrak, ‚òè +1 215-856-7924, toll-free: +1-800-872-7245. Operates train service around the United States of America.   (updated Mar 2022) Routes stopping at Union station:</p>
<p>Metrolink is an extensive regional train network with rail lines radiating out from Union Station to surrounding suburbs and counties, stretching as far as Perris, Lancaster, Oceanside, San Bernardino, and Oxnard.</p>
<p>Several Metrolink lines overlap Amtrak's routes or serve the same cities via a slightly different routing, and Metrolink tickets tend to cost significantly less than Amtrak tickets. Metrolink frequency varies between lines, with service dropping considerably during the weekend; Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner runs far more frequently on the weekends and always runs later in the day than overlapping Metrolink trains.</p>
<p>Fares are based on how far you travel, falling in the range of $5-$15 for one-way fares. Tickets must be bought from vending machines on the platform, and are checked by fare inspectors on board. Metrolink tickets also cover free travel on many connecting local transit systems, including L.A. Metro, where a Metrolink ticket effectively works as a day pass for the date stamped on your ticket. If you're thinking of using Metrolink to day trip on the weekend, you'll want to get the $10 weekend day pass, which is good for unlimited travel on Metrolink (and connecting transit) on either Saturday or Sunday.</p>
<p>Most of the buses are routed to Los Angeles from San Francisco Bay Area (via Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and/or Oxnard); Sacramento (via Modesto, Stockton, Merced and/or Bakersfield); Las Vegas (via Barstow, San Bernardino); Phoenix; and Tijuana (via San Ysidro, San Diego, and/or Santa Ana) with multiple companies.</p>
<p>The majority of the intercity bus stations and stops for the greater Los Angeles area are located in "Skid Row" east of downtown Los Angeles, Union Station, El Monte, Huntington Beach, east L.A. (along Olympic Blvd) and/or Hollywood. Some of the same companies also have additional stops or depots in other areas throughout Greater Los Angeles, so check the company's website to see if there is a stop closer to your destination. When traveling to/from the bus station in the infamous "skid-row" it's recommended to use taxi or rideshare (Uber, Lyft, etc) as the surrounding area has become even less safe:</p>

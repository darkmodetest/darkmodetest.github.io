The boundary of the Free Tram Zone is marked with plenty of signage, but remember to touch on at the start of your journey if you plan to leave the FTZ on that journey. This is in addition to the free City Circle Tram (Route 35).</p>
<p>Buses serve as connections to places without rail transport, often connecting to major shopping centres and train stations. Denoted by orange branding and stops, most buses are low-floor and air-conditioned. A few major trunk routes (including ones such as the 200/207 in the inner north, the 900 to Chadstone, 907 to Doncaster, etc.) operate at 10-15 minute frequencies, although for most buses, it is necessary to use the journey planner or check timetables, as service tends to be far less frequent than trains and trams.</p>
<p>Melbourne taxis are ubiquitous in the centre but less often spotted in the suburbs. Taxis are traditionally yellow in colour, although silver and white colours also exist. Fares are standardized so that the meter starts ticking with the Day Rate (T1) (9AM-5AM) at $4.20 and clocking up $1.622/km, the Overnight Rate (T2) (5AM-9AM) at $5.20 and clocking up $1.804/km and the Peak Rate (T3) (10AM-4AM Friday and Saturday) at $6.20 clocking up $1.986/km, meaning that short hops can go for under $10, but longer hauls get expensive pretty fast. A $2 fee applies for telephone booking a taxi and a $4.78 fee for catching a taxi from the airport. Sitting in traffic is $0.568/min at T1, $0.631/min at T2 and $0.695/min at T3. Between 10PM and 5AM, taxi fares can be prepaid: you pay an estimated sum to the driver in advance and the fare is corrected on arrival. There are no negotiated fares for taxis in Melbourne. The Taxi Services Commission[dead link] provides a full fare list and useful fare estimator on their website.</p>
<p>Driving in Melbourne's city centre is generally inadvisable. Congestion tends to be bad, street parking difficult to find, and parking in multi-storey carparks tends to be rather expensive. In addition, you will have to learn how to execute a hook turn (described below) due to the large number of trams in the city. That being said, driving is generally the best way of getting around Melbourne's suburbs, as the public transport network tends to be less reliable, less frequent and more thinly spread out than in the city centre, particularly in the outer suburbs. If travelling from the outer suburbs to the city, it's generally best to park your car at the nearest railway station and catch a train in. In the centre, street parking can cost more than $3.50 an hour. Melbourne is the only city in Australia where motorcycles and scooters may be parked on footpaths, as long as they don't obstruct the footpath and if there are no signs indicating otherwise.</p>
<p>The major car rental chains are well-represented. Independent car rental companies are also plentiful and can offer good value. Many of the rental companies are located close to Melbourne's Southbank, so if you are staying close to or on the outskirts of the CBD, it should be relatively easy to find both the well represented and independent car rental companies.</p>

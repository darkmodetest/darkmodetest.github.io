There is no control tower, and car rentals in the area are very limited. The YARTS shuttle (see below) is another possibility. Park entrance is an additional 27 mi/44 km via State Route 140.</p>
<p>Amtrak offers service to Yosemite by means of a motorcoach bus that meets its San Joaquins trains in Merced. The San Joaquins provide several departures each day along its route from Bakersfield in the south, Sacramento in the north, and the San Francisco Bay Area in the west. With ample motorcoach connections to and from the trains, this train service serves most of the state, allowing quick and easy access to Merced from most places within the state. The trip to/from San Francisco will take 6+ hours by public transport, compared to 5 hours via car.</p>
<p>Many tour bus companies run tours from the Bay Area. Some will just take you to Yosemite Valley; others provide full tours to see the Giant Sequoias and/or Glacier Point.</p>
<p>The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (YARTS) offers reasonably-priced transportation into Yosemite Valley from locations east and west of the park including Highway 41 (Fresno, Oakhurst, Coarsegold), Highway 140 (Merced - where you can transfer to Amtrak trains to/from San Francisco, Mariposa, El Portal), Highway 120 (Sonora, Jamestown, Groveland) and Highway 120/395 on the east side of the Sierras (Lee Vining, Mammoth Lakes). Ticket price includes park admission, and adult tickets include a free ticket for one child 12 or under. Tickets can be purchased ahead of time or from the shuttle driver, and round-trip fares are between $7 (from El Portal) to $36 (from Mammoth Lakes) into Yosemite Valley; reduced fares are available to seniors, disabled individuals, and children 12 and under. When combined with the free shuttle service that operates within Yosemite Valley, YARTS can eliminate many hassles for summer visitors.</p>
<p>Entrance fees are valid for seven days, allowing unlimited re-entry for the week.  Fees as of 2024 are:</p>
<p>Since Yosemite is so popular, effective 2024 an additional reservation ($2) is required for all vehicles entering the park during the peak season (July-August) and for entry during weekends on holidays in the shoulder seasons (April-June, September-October).  Reservations are valid for entry for three days.  They are released in two tranches: one at the beginning of the year in January, and the second exactly seven days before at 8 AM PT.  Reservations can be made at recreation.gov.</p>
<p>There are several passes for groups traveling together in a private vehicle or individuals on foot/bike that provide free entry to Yosemite National Park and all national parks, as well as some national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and national forests:</p>
<p>The National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks on five days every year:</p>

Yosemite has grown from a little visited, yet historically significant, park to one of the "crown jewels" of the US National Park System. With this stature comes difficulties; Yosemite is the third most visited national park in the United States, with an annual visitation of approximately 4 million, and a majority of those visitors are concentrated in the 12 sq mi (31 km2) within Yosemite Valley (about 1% of the total park land).</p>

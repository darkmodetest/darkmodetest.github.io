<p>Most branches are only served by specific services; from the eastern end of the District line at Upminster, for instance, you can only catch trains for Ealing Broadway and Richmond - if you want to go to Wimbledon, you will have to change trains later down the line. Normally trains stop at all stations with the exception of the Metropolitan line, which have "semi-fast" and "fast" service patterns from Amersham and Chesham, that skip some stations between Finchley Road and Harrow-on-the-Hill. It's also possible that some stations may closed due to some reason, and trains will not stop there, so please pay attention on announcements for any service changes.</p>
<p>There are several sections where more than one line will share tracks with others, or even other services (like Overground and National Rail services), which they may stop at the same platform, so you should pay extra attention for the right train. Mostly you can differentiate the different services by the type of train, though this is not possible on the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, since all four use the same rolling stock on shared lines. Here you will need to pay attention to announcements and signs on the platform and trains.</p>
<p>Signs can be vague, especially if you are unfamiliar with what compass point direction (e.g. northbound) you're travelling in, as these are most often given rather than destinations. A person new to the Tube can become very frustrated trying to work out where a particular connection at a particular station is found. Central and busy stations are staffed by at least two members of staff at all times who can advise you on your route and full system maps are on the walls of every platform and ticket office. Additionally, on every platform, there are individual line maps showing all the stations served by trains calling at that platform. It is always advisable to carry a pocket Tube map to help you with this; the TfL Go and Citymapper apps are also handy tools.</p>
<p>The Northern line has two routes through central London which split at Euston and rejoin at Kennington. The Charing Cross branch runs through the West End, while the Bank branch runs through the City of London. To work out which way your train is going, check the signs above the platform, and on the front of the train. The train's destination and central branch will also be announced on board, for example "This is a Northern line train via Charing Cross, terminating at Edgware." A similar announcement will also appear on the Hainault Loop section on the Central line in North East London.</p>
<p>The London Underground has connections to all terminals at Heathrow and most major London rail termini, with the exception of Fenchurch Street (although this is walking distance from Tower Hill and Aldgate). Interchange hubs are also served, such as Farringdon, Elephant & Castle, Harrow & Wealdstone and Stratford.</p>

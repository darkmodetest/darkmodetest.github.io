Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein are the tourist traps of Amsterdam, so prices are relatively high and there are lots of scams. Zeedijk and Warmoesstraat had a reputation for gang violence and riots in the 1970s and 1980s, but the security situation has improved strongly and now it is safe to visit.</p>
<p>Be cautious in the Red Light District. All kinds of people walk around there during the day, including families with children, but the area does attract seedier visitors and vagrants after sunset. As a tourist hotspot the area attracts a lot of pickpockets. Do not take photographs of the prostitutes, you will be yelled at or worse. Groups of women visiting the Red Light District at night might feel harassed in the aggressive environment, though this is said to be the safest area because of the police presence. Keep to main streets and groups. Although not really dangerous, women might want to avoid the narrow lane north of the Oude Kerk after dark as the atmosphere can be quite intimidating.</p>
<p>Other areas in the city centre are mostly safe, but can get pretty much deserted after midnight, so you might want to avoid walking alone there at night. This is also true for the Kalverstraat and Nieuwendijk, even though shops are lit all night.</p>
<p>The outer boroughs have profound differences in safety levels. Nieuw-West (especially Osdorp) and Zuidoost still have a bruised image regarding violence and harassment.  Urban renewal projects have improved conditions, but you should still be aware of the situation. Noord also has some rougher neighbourhoods, but the rural parts are safe. Oost is largely safe, but there are some neighbourhoods east of Oosterpark where some travelers might not feel comfortable. Zuid is perfectly safe, even at night.</p>
<p>Neighbourhoods with a bad reputation might still be worth seeking out, but be cautious at day and avoid at night. As most tourists only visit the city centre and Zuid, they do not have much to worry about except for the usual precautions (e.g. scams and pickpockets).</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that many tourists come to Amsterdam for the coffeeshops. If you're not a smoker, and you really want to try it, start with something light, make sure you don't have an empty stomach, and don't combine it with any other drugs or intoxicants, including alcohol. Be forthright with the counter person about your inexperience, they see it all the time. Go with an experienced person if you can. Regardless of the strength, your first experience can be quite a sensation at first, but will quickly decrease in intensity. You may want to plan to return to your hotel and "hole up" for a couple hours until you become comfortable with the feeling. If you do find yourself too strongly under the influence—feeling nauseated, woozy or faint—drink orange juice or eat something sweet like cookies or candy, and get fresh air.  Dutch-grown nederwiet (a.k.a. super skunk) is much stronger than you might expect, even if you are experienced. The THC level can be as high as 15%, twice the norm.</p>

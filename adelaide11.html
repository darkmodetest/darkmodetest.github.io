This is sold at numerous pubs and cafes throughout Adelaide, but the place locals will point you to if you want to get the most classic version is Cafe de Vili's in Mile End South.</p>
<p>The AB is Adelaide's answer to the halal snack packs of the East Coast, consisting of yiros meat on top of a bed of hot chips, and topped off with tomato sauce, chilli sauce, garlic sauce and barbecue sauce, though it is not halal. Two shops, namely the North Adelaide Burger Bar (also known as the Red & White) and the Blue & White, both in North Adelaide, claim to have invented the dish.</p>
<p>While fairly unusual in the rest of the world, it's common for restaurants in Australia and New Zealand to allow patrons to bring bottled wine to dinner. This practice is called 'BYO', short for "bring your own". Originally resulting from a loophole in liquor licensing laws, BYO is now a great opportunity to enjoy some of the wine that you have bought in a wine region, or to visit a local 'bottle shop' and enjoy a wider selection at lower prices.</p>
<p>Nowhere in Australia is BYO more common than in Adelaide. Most restaurants in Adelaide which serve alcohol will also allow BYO, though it's a good idea to call ahead to make sure. It's common for a charge called 'corkage' to be applied to the bill. Corkage will typically be around $10–15 per bottle, though higher charges are not unheard of. Corkage is applied even if your wine is under a screwtop rather than a cork, like virtually all recently produced Australian wine.</p>
<p>The City caters to virtually every different taste and price range. Adelaide has one of the largest number of restaurants and cafes per person in Australia and most of the best are in the City.</p>
<p>There are a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide. They don't usually look like much from the outside but most have something going for them - the reason that they are still in business. It pays to look through menus plastered onto doors. Cheap eats should be anywhere from $8–14 for a main, and no more.</p>
<p>There aren't many chains specific to Adelaide, with the sole exception of Fasta Pasta which you can expect to pay from $10 for a plate of pasta. The chain has somewhat become the fast food version of pasta. In more recent times, it can now be found in other states and its popularity in South Australia is due to the chain having started in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of budget eateries in Adelaide, there are more mid-range eateries. They can be found in every part of Adelaide, and if you're on a budget and in an area without budget eateries. Pubs are generally a good place to look for mid-ranged food, with most pubs featuring fish and chips, as well as other Australian staples such as steaks, lamb chops, schnitzels, pasta and risotto.</p>

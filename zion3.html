The remote Kolob Terrace offers an uncrowded and scenic drive, spectacular slot canyons and hiking. The highly photographed "Subway" is found in this section of the park. The more popular (and more crowded) Zion Canyon area is in the southern portion of the park and contains many of the park's most famous scenic wonders such as Angels Landing and the Great White Throne. The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway runs from the south entrance of the park to the east entrance featuring magnificent landmarks and hiking along the way such as East Temple, Checkerboard Mesa and the Great Arch. The Zion Narrows and Orderville Canyon, two of the parks most popular canyons begin on the east rim of the park and end in Zion Canyon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Zion Canyon, the most popular section of the park, is accessed by taking SR-9 from the east or the west. </p>
<p>From Salt Lake City area:
I-15 south to SR-17 at Anderson Junction (exit 27). Turn left at the traffic light onto SR-9 in the town of La Verkin.</p>
<p>From the west:
I-15 passes west of Zion and connects with SR-9 just north of St. George. From there SR-9 travels through the towns of Hurricane, La Verkin, Virgin, and Springdale before entering Zion Canyon. Be aware of the very frequent changes of the speed limit.</p>
<p>From the east:
US-89 passes east of Zion and connects with SR-9 (The Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway) at Mount Carmel Junction. From there SR-9 travels through the park's east Entrance and into the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel before descending into Zion Canyon.</p>
<p>The Kolob Terrace road is accessed off SR-9 in the town of Virgin, west of Zion. The Kolob Canyons entrance is accessible from I-15, exit 40, near Cedar City.</p>
<p>Cars can be rented in Salt Lake City, Cedar City, St. George, and Las Vegas. McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas offers rental cars that usually have good rates.</p>
<p>Visitors driving RVs, pulling trailers, or with any vehicle that is over 7'10" wide or over 11'4" tall should be aware that due to the small size of the tunnel an escort is required to pass through the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel; the fee for this escort is $15, valid for a round-trip. Most RVs, buses, trailers, 5th wheels, and some camper shells require an escort. Escorts are at the tunnel from 8AM-8PM during the busy season and arranged at the entrance gate in the winter.  Semi-tractor trailers are not permitted in the park. See the park website for more information about permits and when they can be used.</p>
<p>The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is accessible only by the Zion Canyon Shuttle the majority of the year, but from November until the end of March, private vehicles are allowed to drive into the canyon.</p>
<p>Parking inside the park is included in the entrance fee. However, the car parks fill up; to be assured a space, arrive well before 9am. Paid parking is available just outside the park near Zion Canyon Visitors Centre, for $30-40.</p>

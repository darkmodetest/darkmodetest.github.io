To contact the police, ambulance or fire brigade emergency service is "000" on the phone for emergencies. "☏ 131 444 (domestic)" is the recommended number for 24/7 Police assistance and general enquiries.</p>
<p>Perth is generally a safe city, with crime rates lower than those of Sydney and Melbourne. However, there are still some areas best avoided late at night, such as Armadale and Midland, which have higher crime rates due to being more economically depressed. The Armadale Line of Transperth Trains is known for its particularly high crime rates, so you should avoid taking it late at night. Otherwise, most violent crime in Perth is fuelled by alcohol, so be very careful when in bars and nightclubs, and stay clear of trouble.</p>
<p>Trains are generally safe with transit guards travelling in pairs, patrolling most scheduled trains after peak hour. All train stations have a time to next train and an emergency button which can be used to call transit guards should the need arise. All stations have live monitored cameras and these can be activated by the simple push of the emergency button. In the train, there are "talk to driver" buttons in every carriage, but some older trains do not have them on every door. You can also call Transperth Security directly on ☏ +61 8 9220 9999. The Midland and Armadale lines have higher crime rates than other lines, so exercise extra caution on these lines at all times, especially at night.</p>
<p>The bus network is generally safe, but after hours can be a little more dangerous than the train network. Some bus routes have limited security patrols available, and some routes have had more than their share of anti social behaviour.</p>
<p>If you have to travel by bus at night, sit as close to the driver as possible and if a problem develops, tell the driver. Often incidents on buses continue for much longer than they should because no one asks the bus driver for assistance.</p>
<p>Exercise caution when crossing the road at pedestrian crossings, walking along the footpath at the entry/exit point of parking lots or when crossing the street at a T-intersection.</p>
<p>Though pedestrians have the legal right of way, some motorists choose to ignore this rule. In the case of pedestrian crossings, cars should slow down for you though caution is advisable. If you do not notice a car slowing down, do not begin to cross. It is usually best to follow the lead of the locals and to move as a group.</p>
<p>Similarly if you are driving a car, you can often encounter people crossing the road at traffic lights who make no allowances for waiting for the lights to be to their advantage, and who will walk across the road when it seems the most inappropriate time.  Look out for pedestrians who walk in front of you when you have a green light.</p>
<p>Driving in Perth can be straightforward, as its highways tend to connect at various nodes making navigation easy. However, avoid travelling during business rush hour (7-9AM and 4-6PM), particularly in summer or on hot days. Many of Perth's major roads were not designed for the volume of traffic it now faces with high population growth. Perth drivers are increasingly known for being inconsiderate to other drivers on the roads during these times, which has also caused increased delays due to accidents.</p>

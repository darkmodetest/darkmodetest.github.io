<p>A special drink only found in Brussels is the "half-en-half" ("half and half"). It's a mixture of white wine and champagne.</p>
<p>Hotel rates in Brussels can vary widely (especially at the upper end) depending on how many EU bigwigs happen to be in town. Good deals are often available on weekends and during the summer when the bureaucrats flee on vacation.</p>
<p>This might come as a shock to the uninitiated, but Brussels is increasingly dealing with the reputation of being a rather unsafe or uneasy city, at least by Western European standards. Though one can argue that it is partially bloated by the media and "word-of-mouth", Brussels has its share of safety issues.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, tourists are unlikely to encounter many safety issues in Brussels' East (Etterbeek, Evere, most of Ixelles), South (Watermael-Boisfort, Woluwe-Saint-Lambert), and Northwest (Jette). Similarly, much of the city center is safe during the day, so long as the basic precautions are taken. On the other hand, many neighborhoods have a reputation for crime and decay, especially at night; this is especially relevant for areas such as Saint-Gilles (especially near the Brussel-Zuid/Bruxelles-Midi station), Matong√©, Anneessens (around Place Fontainas), Molenbeek (mostly areas next to the canal), Schaerbeek (the western areas within close proximity of the Brussels-North station), and the Marolles. Though most travelers are unlikely to visit them, one should always be on their guard, especially since an area's (subjective) safety can change incredibly fast in Brussels, so know where you're going when doing so. Ask a local for advice if possible. Do keep in mind that, not unlike Paris, the topic of crime in these aforementioned areas might bear racial undertones, and some locals will get feisty if you mention anything regarding the origins of people in these neighborhoods.</p>
<p>This map gives an indication of the less attractive and inviting areas (in red), although the attractiveness and subjective safety of an area can change quickly street by street. A seemingly safe street might sit right next to a rough area, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Pickpocketing is by far the most likely issue you will come across in Brussels, with the city frequently ranking high by European standards. Pickpocketing has been reported in nearly every neighborhood in Brussels. This activity is mainly carried out by teams in crowded tourist areas, train and metro stations, major events, and parks (even during the daytime). Those who commit these petty crimes are really professional. Therefore, as usual, it's better not to unnecessarily show valuables publicly, especially when looking as a tourist. Some areas with particularly high risks of pickpocketing include the European Quarter, Bourse/Beurs, Forest National, and the major train stations.</p>
<p>As with most major cities, parks in Brussels are safe during the day, but best avoided at night. Most big parks don't have any (sufficient) lighting. Examples are those around the Atomium (Laeken and Osseghem parks) and the Bois de La Cambre/Ter Kamerenbos. Although they are mostly deserted at night, it's always better to be careful; Laeken and Osseghem are near sketchy areas, whereas the Bois de la Cambre has a history of aggravated assaults. Gangs often take over smaller parks scattered throughout the city at night.</p>

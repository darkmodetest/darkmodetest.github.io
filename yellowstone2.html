<p>Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of mammals in the lower 48 states. Sixty-seven different mammals live here, including grizzly bears and black bears. Gray wolves were hunted to extinction by 1926, but reintroduced from Canada in 1995, and more than 100 live in the park now, making it one of the best places to see them in the wild. In addition, the park is also home to thriving populations of coyotes and red foxes. Wolverine and lynx, which require large expanses of undisturbed habitat, are also found in the Yellowstone ecosystem. Seven native ungulate species - elk, mule deer, bison, moose, bighorn sheep, pronghorn, and white-tailed deer live here. Non-native mountain goats have colonized northern portions of the park and numerous small mammals, including beavers, are found throughout the park.</p>
<p>Records of bird sightings have been kept in Yellowstone since its establishment in 1872; these records document 330 species of birds to date, of which approximately 148 species are known to nest in the park. The variation in elevation and broad array of habitat types found within the park contributes to the region's relatively high diversity.</p>
<p>Glacial activity and current cool and dry conditions are likely responsible for the relatively small number of reptiles and amphibians found in the park.</p>
<p>Yellowstone is home to more than 1,350 species of vascular plants, of which 218 are non-native.</p>
<p>The weather in Yellowstone National Park can change very rapidly from sunny and warm to cold and rainy, so it's important to bring along extra layers of clothing which can be used as needed.  Snow can fall in Yellowstone at any time of the year.</p>
<p>The principal airport serving Yellowstone is Jackson Hole Airport (JAC IATA), in Grand Teton National Park, near Jackson, and the largest airport in Wyoming. United and Delta serve Jackson Hole year-round, from Denver and Salt Lake City respectively. These airlines plus American and Frontier provide seasonal flights from those cities and eight others across the US.</p>

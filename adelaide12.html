Cuisine wise, it's pretty easy to find Italian and Indian cuisines. Finding Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai) cuisines is also easy, but they may not match the standards in Sydney while finding Greek and Mediterranean cuisine is also easy, but offerings may not match the standard found in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Finding a fine dining restaurant in the city is pretty easy, but finding one in the suburbs is considerably less so. That said, the suburbs also have some excellent fine dining options if you know where to look. The nearby wine regions like McLaren Vale and the Barossa Valley also have excellent fine dining options, with several wineries having restaurants overlooking their vineyards that only open for lunch. Unlike other cities, if you're going to a fine dining restaurant, there is no dress code. See the #Dress codes section.</p>
<p>As Australians are generally casual, feel free to wear whatever you think suits well. Although most people make an effort to dress up for fancier restaurants, there is no requirement and both restaurants and diners alike are relaxed about dress standards, and so it's not uncommon to see people wearing jeans at restaurants, especially among the younger generations.</p>
<p>There are pubs and bars (also known as "hotels" in Australia) dotted all around the CBD, but a few districts are worth singling out. Rundle Street and its neighbouring area  known simply as "The East End" have a number of popular pubs. Hindley St used to be notorious as the seedy home of Adelaide's strip clubs and bikie bars, but it has undergone a renaissance, along with "The West End". The eastern end of Hindley Street is more mainstream, whereas the western end, west of Morphett Street has a few trendier and more alternative venues. The seedy places are still there, but so too is a university campus and a number of trendy bars and clubs. Also important are Gouger Street and its many restaurants but with an increasing number of bars and pubs.  O'Connell Street is home to a few of North Adelaide's popular pubs.</p>
<p>There are also many bars in the suburbs of Adelaide which are usually busier on Thursday and Friday evenings. Quite a few of the locals will go to the hotels in the suburbs on Thursday and Friday evenings, and go into the Adelaide CBD on Saturday evenings.</p>
<p>Smoking in pubs and clubs is banned under South Australian law. Many drinking establishments have outdoor areas where smoking is permitted.</p>
<p>Adelaide has hundreds of accommodation options in the CBD (central business district, i.e. downtown) to consider, from backpackers hotels to five star hotels. However, there are options out of the central area too.</p>
<p>If you are travelling on business, there may be business-style accommodation near to where you are working, but otherwise, the city centre generally has more availability. </p>
<p>If you are into camping, the closest camping to the city is in Belair National Park in the southeastern suburbs of Adelaide. The park is less than 10 km from the city, and there is a train service near the park.</p>

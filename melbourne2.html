Melbournians belatedly recognised the loss of their architectural heritage and steps were taken to protect what was left. Construction of the huge Crown Casino (briefly the largest casino in the world) in the 1990s introduced glitz and gambling to the city centre. Melbourne's development continues in the 2000s with the opening of the Melbourne Museum, Federation Square and the Docklands precinct.</p>
<p>Melbourne is the cultural capital of Australia, with its many art galleries, film festivals, orchestras, choral and opera productions, vibrant live music scene, and a strong food, wine and coffee culture. People in Melbourne tend to dress up more than the northern states - partly due to the colder climate.  Many bars and clubs have strict dress regulations, such as requiring collars and dress shoes for men.</p>
<p>Particular cultural events to note include the Melbourne International Film Festival in August, the International Art Festival in October, and the Melbourne Comedy Festival in April. There are also many concerts and exhibitions throughout the year. In addition to the Melbourne Museum, there are special museums dedicated to subjects such as science, immigration, Chinese history, Jewish history, sport, racing, film and moving image, railways, police, fire brigades and banking.</p>
<p>Melbourne also has a strong subcultural scene appealing especially to young people, particularly in the suburbs of Carlton, Fitzroy, Collingwood and Abbotsford, where subcultural bars, cafes and art galleries are common. Check out the Abbotsford Convent and Brunswick Street Fitzroy.</p>
<p>Melbourne is welcoming of LGBT+ people, who generally live in the city with few difficulties.</p>
<p>While often referred to as Australia's cultural capital, Melbourne also draws much more influence from Europe in its architecture, fashion and food – and for the gay traveller it may feel like a more chilled out and refined experience after the glitz of Sydney. Melbourne is a city of less ostentatious delights than its northern cousin, regularly voted the world's most livable city – so set some time aside to relax and explore.</p>
<p>The gay scene in Melbourne is basically divided between the north side and south side of the city. In the north side the best options are Sircuit Bar (mixed on Tuesday and Sunday) or The Laird for guys of the bear variety.</p>
<p>Melbourne's main annual community events are the Midsumma Festival and the Melbourne Queer Film Festival.</p>
<p>Melbournians are sports enthusiasts and particularly passionate about Australian rules football, a sport invented in Melbourne. In fact the Australian Football League (AFL) is not so much a sport as a religion in Melbourne, with 9 of the 10 Victorian teams being based in Melbourne. As a guide, the entire national competition only has 18 teams, meaning half the league is based in Melbourne alone. The AFL culminates in the AFL Grand Final in the spring, which is played every year at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Horse racing is another passion, and the majority of the state has a public holiday on the first Tuesday of November for the racing of the Melbourne Cup, one of the world's famous horse races. Cricket is the big summer sport and the Melbourne Cricket Ground (the 'MCG' or 'The G') is one of the world's leading grounds. On Boxing Day each year, the MCG hosts the boxing day test match. This usually sees the Australian Cricket team going up against another big cricketing nation. The MCG is also home to the National Sports Museum (NSM) (including the Racing Museum), Australia's only truly dedicated multi-sports museum.</p>

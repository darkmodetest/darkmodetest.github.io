<p>Right next to the centre is the historic district of The Rocks where you see Sydney's heritage as well as walk across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p>
<p>Darling Harbour is west of the City Centre and offers plenty of attractions such as the National Maritime Museum, Sydney Fish Market, Sydney Wildlife World, Sydney Aquarium and the Powerhouse Museum.</p>
<p>Cross the Harbour Bridge to reach the Lower North Shore where you can visit Luna Park. Taronga Zoo can be reached by a dedicated ferry from Circular Quay.</p>
<p>Take the ferry further out to Manly where you can visit the famous beach and walk to Middle Head passes many coastal artillery fortifications built into the cliffs of Sydney Harbour during the late nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Head out in the sun to visit the Eastern Suburbs where you can find the world famous Bondi beach, as well as many other beaches and La Perouse.</p>
<p>Sydney offers many opportunities to discover indigenous heritage, with rock carvings, dancing and art galleries to explore.</p>
<p>Sydney is known for its dozens of vibrant suburbs, which reflect upon the beauty and diversity of the city all because of its character.</p>
<p>Sydney also offers opportunities to see wild Australian animals</p>
<p>Sydney's world-famous beauty is defined by Sydney Harbour that can be easily viewed from the city and many areas around it. The large natural harbour was the reason that the original penal settlement was established in the area, near what is now known as Circular Quay.</p>
<p>An excellent way to see both the harbour and Sydney attractions is to take any ferry from Circular Quay. These are very reasonably priced and a favourite with tourists who can see most of the harbour from the various routes offered. Heading to Manly on the ferry makes for a great 30 minute trip at a fraction of the price of a commercial harbour cruise.</p>
<p>The world famous Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race begins every year on Boxing Day, on Sydney Harbour. Thousands of spectator craft take to the water to farewell the yachts as they set off on their gruelling journey to Hobart. Seaworthy craft can follow the yachts through the Sydney Heads into the open ocean. You can also see the race from a harbour vantage point like Watsons Bay. where you can see them sail towards you across the harbour, and then cross to the gap to see them sail down the coast.</p>
<p>Sydney's beaches are the perfect place to spend a warm summer day, where you can swim or lie on the sands to your heart's content. The most popular are Bondi, Manly, Cronulla and Coogee, although many others have their own charms. They might not be miles of golden beaches like Queensland, but there's a great variety, ranging from ocean beaches nestled between towering headlands in the Eastern Suburbs to quiet bays facing the harbour in Mosman. Bondi and Coogee are backpacker haunts while Manly and Cronulla feel like separate seaside towns. Soak in the crowded atmosphere amongst the other sunseekers in the eastern beaches, or be one of the few enjoying the solitude in the Northern Beaches and the Royal National Park. Brave the ocean waves, or splash about in the shallower rock pools. Even in winter, you can join the hardy souls keeping to their exercise regime in the cold waters.</p>

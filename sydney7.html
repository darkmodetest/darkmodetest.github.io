Alternatively, you could get a train full of people packed in like sardines, with station announcements that are barely audible. Prepare yourself with your smartphone network map, just in case. All Sydney Trains are air-conditioned.</p>
<p>Most train services do not stop at every station and do not travel to the furthest extent of the line. Look at the departure screens at the station concourse which indicate when the next train will arrive, its destination, the platform it will depart from, and the stations it will stop at. Alternatively, you can also listen to announcements that will regularly play before and when a train arrives at the platform. Or simply download an app that gives you platforms and times (with real time updates if you have mobile internet).</p>
<p>Outside of operating hours, between midnight (1AM on Fridays and Saturdays) and 5AM, NightRide buses run at least every hour. NightRide buses stop at most stations and a few additional stops, but they do not travel on the same routes. If you intend catching a NightRide bus home, check the NightRide route map. Buses can be crowded on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
<p>Exercise caution whilst travelling on trains after 8PM, particularly if the carriage is mostly deserted and if travelling to western and south western Sydney, as it is not uncommon for undesirables to be found on trains during these times. 99% of the time they will not cause you any more trouble other than being loud, vulgar and obnoxious, but it is best to avoid them as unwanted altercations may follow. Moving to other carriages would be a good idea. The more modern trains have Emergency Help Points in every carriage, allowing contact with the train guard. Otherwise, travel in the middle carriages, near the guard's compartment (marked with a blue light). The guard has contact with police and the driver if there is any trouble on the train. Emergency Help Points are also available at every station.</p>
<p>Check for track work before leaving for the station; Sydney Trains shut down part of the network most weekends and will transfer passengers to buses if lines are closed. The process may add half an hour or more to a typical journey. Track work is usually on weekends or late at night on weekdays and the track work timetable is available on the Sydney trains website several months in advance (check before you leave home for the days you are visiting).</p>
<p>As of 2024, Sydney only has one metro line (M1), which runs from Tallawong in far northwestern sydney through Chatswood, North Sydney, Barangaroo and Central. Services operate on automated driverless trains at a turn up and go frequency with similar operating hours to the rest of the rail network. Services are marked with a teal-coloured 'M' in a roundel at stations and on the rail network map. The line is integrated with the suburban train network and you can interchange between the services at Chatswood and Epping stations. </p>

It is unhealthy for them, and may be unhealthy for you. A seemingly tame squirrel might bite you – they carry plague, rabies, etc.  A deer or elk can charge at you without warning.  If the animal is aware of your presence, you're too close.</p>
<p>Temperatures and weather within the canyon vary greatly by location.  Temperatures on the North Rim are often 20–30°F (11–16°C) cooler than at the river.  This is a land of extremes. It can be snowing at the rim, while others are comfortable sunbathing at the river. Conversely, it can be cool and comfortable at the rim in the summer, while temperatures at the river exceed 120 °F (49 °C).  It is not unusual for local canyon guides to encounter neophyte hikers in desperate shape.  Some die. An unusual number of fatalities occur among young people who overestimate their abilities. Due to the high altitude, snowfall is a regular occurrence on the rims during the winter months. The North Rim closes during the winter season.</p>
<p>July and August are monsoon season in Arizona and strong thunderstorms can sweep in quickly with lightning strikes every few minutes and sudden downpours. Flash floods can occur suddenly, even in areas where there is not immediate rain; rain can originate upstream and quickly rush downstream. Due to the elevation of the Grand Canyon rims, people are struck by lightning fairly regularly so take shelter indoors during storms.</p>
<p>The majority of visitors to the South Rim of the park arrive from the south on Arizona Route 64 (AZ 64, conjoined with US highway 180). Or, you can enter the South Rim from the east on AZ 64.</p>
<p>For the south entrance: from Flagstaff, you can take US Route 180 (US 180) northwest to Valle where it joins with AZ 64, and continue north to the South Rim; or take I-40 west toward Williams to the junction with AZ 64 and continue north to the South Rim. Both routes are approximately 80 miles (130 km). The approximately 60 miles (100 km) on US 180 is a narrow 2-lane mountain road through a heavily forested area. The I-40 west is a wide multi-lane interstate for approximately 20 mi (32 km), to AZ 64 which is a slightly wider, less mountainous 2-lane highway, and the recommended route during winter weather.  There are two lanes at this entrance reserved for pass and prepaid entrance fees (now lanes 1 and 4), which can be pre-purchased outside of the park at the National Geographic Theater/Visitor Center.</p>
<p>For the east entrance, take US 89 south from Page, AZ or north from Flagstaff to the junction with AZ 64 at Cameron. It is approximately 25 mi (40 km) from the junction to the east entrance of the park, and approximately 25 mi (40 km) from the east entrance to the South Rim village area.</p>
<p>Visitors to the North Rim use ALT US Route 89 (US 89A, not to be confused with AZ 89A south of Flagstaff) to AZ 67 (closed in winter).  While the average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles (16 km), there are no roads or bridges or ferries, meaning the trip by car is a five-hour drive of 215 mi (346 km). </p>

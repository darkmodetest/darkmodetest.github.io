<p>Being the capital of Australia, the city has no shortage of museums for a city of its size. Many of its museums are in two particular districts, South Canberra, and Acton. Many of South Canberra's museums are mostly spread out evenly, while most of Acton's museums are part of the Australian National University campus, and as such, many relate to educational content that's found at unis.</p>
<p>Not withstanding, there are plenty of museums in other districts too, just not as many – such as the National Dinosaur Museum in Gungahlin, which showcases a good range of dinosaur exhibitions in Australia, or the Canberra Space Centre, which is one of the premiere astrotourism sites in Australia.</p>
<p>The seat of Australia's federal government and legislature and a remarkable piece of modern architecture. Outside, the forecourt faces Federation Mall and has iconic views. Much of the inside is open to the public during business hours, and free tours are operated at certain times. On sitting days, you are allowed to view proceedings in the public gallery from 2PM onwards while viewing Question Time from the House of Representatives galleries can be done via a booking.</p>
<p>Parliament House is arguably less politically restricted than, say, the White House in the United States – you will be screened upon entry but that's about it.</p>
<p>As the national capital, Canberra hosts the embassies of most countries, listed below in Embassies. Many of the embassies are built in an architectural style typical of their country. In Yarralumla (the closest embassy district to the city), the Embassy of China, Embassy of Papua New Guinea, The Royal Thai Embassy and the building which hosts the Estonian and Finnish embassies are particularly worth a look. The Embassy of the United States of America is also worth a drive past, being the oldest embassy in Canberra. It is best to have a car or bicycle for touring so you can stop and have a look around. Most of the embassies in the suburb of O'Malley are converted houses, and none feature interesting architecture. Several of the embassies hold annual open days on weekends in Spring and Autumn which usually include stalls serving their native food.</p>
<p>With Canberra unofficially crowned a bush capital, it is no surprise there is plenty to see when it comes to exploring its natural scenery. There are many hiking paths to explore around Canberra along with plenty of great vantage points to view the city, with many being accessible by car or by foot. Wildlife are commonly found in the surrounding nature reserves, but on lucky occasions you may spot wildlife that venture into the suburbs. Kangaroos occasionally penetrate into Civic, and hop down Northbourne Avenue from time to time. If ever you encounter wildlife on your visit be sure to admire from a distance.</p>

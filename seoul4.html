The base charge roughly covers up to 10 km (6.2 mi) of the journey and ₩100 is added for every 5 km (3.1 mi) beyond that. Cards can be purchased from vending machines only. All vending machines accept coins and bills, up to ₩10,000 notes (and some ₩50,000 notes, but cash exchange machines are at each station). Hang onto your card until the end of your trip, as you'll need it to get out. Most of Seoul's automated card machines are equipped with touchscreen and full English support (along with Chinese and Japanese).</p>
<p>If planning on using the Metro extensively or staying for more than a couple of days, you should consider purchasing a T-money stored value contactless smart card. You can buy this card from staffed desks at most subway stations, many newspaper kiosks near subway entrances, and convenience stores with the T-money logo. The most basic card costs ₩2,500, and cash can be added to the card as often as you like. When entering and leaving a subway turnstile, place the card on the reader (leaving it inside your purse or wallet is fine), and it will deduct the appropriate fare from the card. Using this card will allow you to save ₩100 on all transfers (these are common with Seoul's extensive subway system), and you can get all but ₩500 back if you have unused credit. Any value on the T-money card never expires. Credit refund up to ₩20,000 can be received in most convenience stores. Above ₩20,000 you can still get a refund, but the procedure is more complicated, so it's wise to keep your credit below that figure.</p>
<p>Typically for most travellers staying less than a week in Seoul, purchasing this card may not be cheaper, but other factors should be considered: it can also be used for taxi fares, buses, storage lockers, pay phones, etc. The T-money card is far more convenient than buying per trip ticket. Using a transportation card is highly recommended if you wish to use it between subways and buses, simply for its ability to transfer for free since you will not have to pay for the basic fare twice for a single journey when using two modes of transport. Note that the subway does not operate late at night.</p>
<p>Be aware that any issues (e.g. unsufficient balance) are not displayed in English at the turnstiles. Only the error code is shown in latin letters. The different error codes are listed at the metro website.</p>
<p>If you're using the AREX in Seoul, you still need to buy a ticket or use the T-money card to enter the subway station area from which you reach the AREX platforms. You'll get a refund later on when you buy an AREX ticket.</p>
<p>Here are some things to know when riding the subway.</p>

Some particularly good ones include That Gelato Place, in Weston Creek, which has a distinct variety of gelato ice cream as the name says, Stripey Sundae in Ginninderra, Gelato Messina in either Kingston or Braddon, Via Dolce in the city or if you're looking to see a bit of creativity, try Mookie or Goodberry’s. For a bit of Filipino flavours, try Lolo and Lola, which is a Filipino owned ice cream shop with plenty of flavours in it – and quite a unique one.</p>
<p>However, do be aware that the ice cream stores in Canberra are very sweet, more so than the ice cream found pretty much elsewhere in Australia. Nevertheless, if you're prepared to embrace the sweetness, they are worth a try.</p>
<p>Canberra's many bars and clubs will be closed on Sunday nights and early into the week. Civic can appear to be a ghost town but there are areas such as Bunda Street where you will always find some happening funky bars</p>
<p>Most of Canberra's hotels are in or around Civic or the suburbs which are adjacent to the Parliamentary Triangle. A few hotels have opened in the Belconnen, Gungahlin, Tuggeranong and Woden town centres. The availability of accommodation can be tight during periods in which Parliament is sitting - the schedule for parliamentary sittings is available here.</p>
<p>Generally, it is not too hard to find mid-range accommodation in Canberra because practically nearly every hotel and motel in Canberra falls into the "mid-range" category.</p>
<p>There are a number of splurge hotels in Canberra; many of them are located in South Canberra near Parliamentary Triangle. The price range is usually above $250 for a night, but this can significantly go up during holiday season, and Parliament sittings.</p>
<p>There are a number of Bed and Breakfast places just off Northbourne Avenue, in North Canberra. These tend to be mid-range, cost-wise, but are comfortable and refreshing if you are looking for a 'home away from home'.</p>
<p>Serviced, short-term apartments are widely available throughout Canberra and are available for stays as short as one night. Amenities typically include kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms. A full range of properties exist from budget to 5 star.</p>
<p>Canberra is a very safe city and enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in Australia. Take the usual precautions against opportunistic crime, however. Valuables should not be left in sight within unattended cars, especially overnight.</p>
<p>Despite its apparent affluence, Canberra has people who live the rough life. Particularly around Civic, it is not unusual to be asked for money. If you simply say that you don't have any money, the beggar will usually move on.</p>
<p>Once you leave Civic, Canberra is fairly spread out. For much of the year, evenings can become cold and windy fairly quickly. Don’t count on adequate lighting even in otherwise popular or marked footways/cycleways. Similarly, when traveling on such routes in between city centres, or when in the bush, it is possible not to see anyone else for an entire journey. Have a map and appropriate clothing. On hot days, carry water. For bicycle riders, having the means to fix a puncture, and having proper lights is necessary in Canberra.</p>

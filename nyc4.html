<p>Traditionally, English in New York City was spoken with distinctive accents, which differed according to ethnicity, neighborhood and social class (compare the Queens accent of Donald Trump with the Brooklyn accent of Bernie Sanders, both New Yorkers, as an example). Some of these accents are notable for being among the few non-rhotic American accents. You may still encounter the traditional accents when talking to older working-class New Yorkers. Due to its large Ashkenazi Jewish population, many Yiddish terms have also made their way into local English slang. You may also hear the New York dialect of African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) being spoken among African-Americans, and a distinctive dialect known as New York Latino English, with noticeable influences from Puerto Rican and Dominican Spanish, is spoken by many Latinos. The long-established Jewish American and Italian-American communities have developed their own dialects that can still be heard throughout the city.</p>
<p>New York City (NYC  IATA for all airports) is well connected by air with flights from almost every corner of the world. Three large airports, and several small ones, serve the region. John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK IATA) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA) are large international airports, while LaGuardia Airport (LGA IATA) is a busy domestic airport. All three airports are run by The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Inter-airport transfers:</p>
<p>Scammers outside of the arrivals terminals at JFK will offer their services, claiming to be Uber drivers and that their original fare cancelled their ride. In many cases they will show the Uber logo either on a sign or on a smartphone. </p>
<p>Under no circumstances should you accept such offers! These people are not Uber drivers and many of them are not even licensed taxi drivers. These scammers will charge several times the rate into Manhattan, and add extras, such as “tax” and “tip.” In some cases, drivers have charged as much as $1,300 for the trip.</p>
<p>If somebody like this approaches you, simply and firmly say “No.” Do not let them touch any of your luggage and do not allow them to intimidate you in any way. Do not hesitate to call the police on 911 if the scammers persist. The authorities will always back you in such incidents, despite the scammer's threats of possible arrest or deportation.</p>
<p>40.639722-73.7788891 John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK IATA). New York's main airport and a major hub for American, Delta, and JetBlue, as well as other domestic and international airlines. If you are arriving into New York by plane from overseas, it is likely that JFK will be your point of entry.   (updated Sep 2018)</p>
<p>If you arrive at this airport from overseas, be prepared to wait in line at Customs & Border Protection, often over an hour if you are not a permanent resident of the United States. As cellphones are not allowed in waiting lines, you may want to bring a book or other non-digital entertainment. If you are departing from this airport, beware that it's a huge and congested airport with six terminals. Make sure you know what terminal you're leaving from before you get to the airport, and it's recommended that you arrive 2 hours before domestic flights and 3 hours before international ones, to check in and pass through security without a huge increase in blood pressure and/or a last minute dash worthy of the Olympics, but without any of the medals.</p>

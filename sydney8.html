<p>Sydney has an extensive bus network. Some buses run from distant suburbs such as those on the Northern Beaches and North West all the way to the city, but there are also shorter feeders to suburban rail stations from surrounding suburbs.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to plan your bus trips in advance where possible. Transportnsw.info has a helpful trip planner feature to assist you, as well as route maps and schedules to print. Most bus stops have timetables posted, as well as a route map for the routes servicing that bus stop.</p>
<p>You must flag down buses with an outstretched hand if you want them to stop for you and you must press the STOP button on board to disembark. They will not automatically stop unless they are signalled to do so.</p>
<p>On most buses there is nothing on the bus to tell you which stop you are approaching or which stop you are at. There are no poster maps on the bus either. If you're heading into unfamiliar territory, either take a paper timetable to track your route, or make sure you have an app downloaded to track your route and stops (Tripview/Moovit, etc). Also, if you take a bus marked "Limited Stops" or "Express" (the route number will start with an L or an X or an E), make sure that the bus stops where you want it to. Limited stops services stop only at major stops so they may make you walk around 750 metres or so if they skip your stop. However, express services can run very far from the city without stopping at all, before resuming a normal stopping pattern (express buses only operate during peak hours). All normally numbered buses stop at all stops, so missing your stop or getting off one stop early is a less serious mistake. Red Metrobuses (routes numbers starting with M) are longer route, cross city buses, running at 10- to 20-minute frequencies during their operational hours. These buses sometimes have a screen displaying the next stop and onboard announcements as well. Metrobus stops usually have a name on top of the stand which easily indicates a Metrobus services the particular stop.</p>
<p>There are two main bus termination points in the CBD, at Wynyard and Circular Quay. These two points are separated by a one-stop commuter train trip. You will need to make this trip if connecting from buses arriving from north of the Harbour Bridge to buses heading east or west, or vice versa. There are bus information centres at Wynyard and Circular Quay. During peak hours some buses from the south and west terminate at Town Hall to avoid congestion in the CBD.</p>
<p>All buses are GPS-equipped, so you can use an app like TripView, Google Maps or Citymapper to track arrival times in real time.</p>
<p>A few trunk routes run to the Eastern Suburbs and to Newtown 24 hours a day. Additional services operate late Friday and Saturday night to the Northern Beaches and to the North West.</p>

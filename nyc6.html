From here you can take a NJ Transit train (30-min ride, every 15-30 min) to New York Penn Station (34th St & 8th Ave in Manhattan) or Amtrak train to other destinations along the east coast. Amtrak also runs trains to Manhattan, but they cost $20-30. NJ Transit tickets are not valid on Amtrak trains. NJ Transit trains stop at both Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station, so if your destination is Manhattan, stay on till you reach New York Penn Station.</p>
<p>Newark Airport's station along the Northeast Corridor gives it a major advantage over JFK and LGA, as long-distance Amtrak trains coming from as far south as Virginia, as far north as Massachusetts, and as far west as Harrisburg also stop at the station.</p>
<p>40.77725-73.8726113 LaGuardia Airport (LGA IATA). The smallest of the New York Metropolitan Area's three major airports, but also the closest to Midtown Manhattan. Almost all direct flights to LGA are from destinations within 1,500 miles. Most flights are domestic; however, there are international flights from Canada, Aruba, the Bahamas and Bermuda. The Art Deco Marine Air Terminal, used by Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, is one of the oldest airport terminals that is still in use in the world. It had long been considered dingy and one of the worst major airports to fly out of, but that has changed with the opening of the new Terminal B in 2021, and the new Terminal C in 2022, and it is now quite pleasant to use.   </p>
<p>LaGuardia does not have a direct rail or subway connection to the rest of the city. Your best bet for reaching Manhattan is to take a taxi or use a rideshare app. Most taxi or rideshare fares to Midtown Manhattan from LaGuardia will average $40-45 before tip. Trips via the Queens-Midtown Tunnel or RFK Bridge will incur a toll in addition to the fare. Traffic between Manhattan and LaGuardia can be awful during rush hours but generally is not a big issue outside of peak commuting times. If you feel comfortable using public transportation, two MTA Select Bus Service routes serve the airport. These buses can be very crowded at times but they do include luggage racks and operate 24 hours a day with a fair degree of frequency. The M60-SBS can take you to the area of Upper Manhattan around Columbia University via the Astoria neighborhood of Queens and 125th Street in Harlem. The Q70-SBS LaGuardia Link provides a connection to busy public transit hubs in the Woodside and Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens, where you can then connect onward to multiple subway, LIRR and bus lines. As of late 2022, riding the Q70 is free of charge. The M60 costs the standard bus fare of $2.90 per passenger.</p>

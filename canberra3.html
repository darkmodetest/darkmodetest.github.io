There are only a handful of food outlets and a single newsagent inside the terminal, with the meal options being expensive and low quality even by airport standards. ATMs and payphones are located on both sides of security. Qantas and Virgin have their own airport lounges within the terminal, and the waiting area for international flights offers fairly basic lounge-style services for all passengers. To keep yourself entertained you could venture around the terminal and its grounds to try and locate six public art sculptures that are on display.</p>
<p>As Canberra Airport is fairly new and small, the process of passing through security at the start of a flight and collecting your luggage on arrival is usually very fast in comparison to the other capital city airports. Completing immigration and customs checks for international departures and arrivals is also much faster than at major airports.</p>
<p>Taxis are available from the indoor taxi queue on the ground floor and cost $25 to Civic. Fares to Canberra's suburbs can be much higher, for instance at least $50 to Tuggeranong or Belconnen.</p>
<p>Ridesharing service Uber operates in Canberra and is usually cheaper than taxis. Canberra Airport has a dedicated passenger waiting lounge located 20 metres from the ground floor exit of the arrivals hall.</p>
<p>Canberra Airport is connected to Civic by public bus route R3. Services arrive and depart from outside the baggage claim area on the ground floor of the airport every 15 minutes or less during weekdays, and 30 minutes on weekends. The route is serviced by standard Transport Canberra buses, which do not include luggage racks for large suitcases, however most have space for medium-sized suitcases near the driver, and the buses are rarely crowded. A Single adult fare between Civic and the airport is $4.90 each way, or less if using a MyWay card.</p>
<p>The Royale Group also runs a shuttle[dead link] which costs $10 one way to/from Civic. Frequency is 30–60 minutes, the ride takes 20–30 minutes and it operates daily 7AM-6PM (reduced frequency on weekends).</p>
<p>Several car rental services have kiosks in the Arrival Hall. Internationally known and reputable companies like Budget Car Hire, Thrifty, Hertz, RedSpot, Avis, and Europcar are available. When returning car rentals, there is a Caltex petrol station adjacent to the terminal.</p>
<p>It is possible to use Canberra's off-road cycleway network to reach the airport. Follow the cycleway along the north side of the lake. A section of cycleway runs along the Molonglo River underneath the Monaro Highway Bridge; it veers left and passes underneath the Pialligo Avenue bridges. Turn right, cross the creek (beware of the gravel surface at this point), cross over Fairbairn Avenue, use the airport service road through the airport precinct, and make your way to the terminal. The ACTION public bus also carries bicycles on the front racks.</p>
<p>There are ample-sized covered and uncovered car parks within walking distance of the terminal. The uncovered car park is cheaper. Expect to pay $20–25 per day, with special weekend rates.</p>

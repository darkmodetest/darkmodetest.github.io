It immediately enters steep hills on the edge of the city, but sees little traffic, is well maintained and passes though lovely landscape of farmland and forests.  It's remarkable how close to Beijing you are, and how far it feels.</p>
<p>For the most up-to-date maps, use Baidu or AutoNavi Maps (Amap) on your smartphone. Baidu Maps is in Chinese, whilst AutoNavi Maps are available in foreign languages inside Apple Maps (when in China). Apple's built-in Maps app remains accessible and is a common alternative. Google Maps is blocked in China.</p>
<p>Beijing boasts a world-class public transportation network, featuring an extensive subway system that reaches most major tourist attractions. Frequent buses and dockless shared bicycles available outside stations complement the subway, providing convenient last-mile connectivity. Many locals use ride-hailing apps like DiDi for transportation. For visitors, ordering a taxi in English is possible through the Alipay app (using Amap) or WeChat (using DiDi). Alternatively, you can install the DiDi app and link it to Alipay for seamless payment.</p>
<p>Do not count on finding a taxi driver or passerby who knows English well. Neither should foreigners with minimal experience with the Chinese language put faith in their ability to pronounce Chinese place names correctly. Before embarking on a trip around the city, it is best to print out the names of places you want to visit in Chinese characters or get your hotel front desk staff to write them out for you. When going to specific addresses, writing nearby intersections or basic directions can be helpful as well. Show the text to the taxi driver or just ask for help on the street. In general, you will have a better chance of getting help in English if you address younger people.</p>
<p>Crossing the road in Beijing may be challenging for pedestrians unused to the local driving styles. Before crossing, assume that none of the road users will yield to you, even if a policeman is present. Zebra crossings are often ignored. Chinese drivers frequently use their horns and may play games of chicken with pedestrians and other vehicles. Should you hear a loud horn when crossing the road, always look around as there is probably a car right behind you or heading straight for you. If you find several cars and bicycles veering towards you from different directions, do not try to run to safety; instead, stand still. For drivers and cyclists, a stationary obstacle is easier to avoid. Traffic light crossings have zebra stripes painted on the road, but you should only cross when the walk light is green. When a mass of people crosses together, cars are more likely to stop or slow down.</p>
<p>The Beijing Subway is one of the world's most extensive systems with 27 lines and 490 stations covering an impressive 836 km (519 mi), with one line extending beyond the municipality's boundaries into Langfang in Hebei province. It is clean, reliable and efficient. The networkâ€™s grid-like design and bilingual signage make it surprisingly easy to navigate, especially given its size. Announcements are also bilingual in Mandarin and English. Operating hours are from around 05:00 to 22:30, with specific times posted at station entrances.</p>

Despite the cold weather and occasional rainfall you should not expect to see any snow within Hobart, although it is not unheard of. The city receives snowfall at sea level on average only once every 15 years, caused by cold masses arriving from Antarctica. More often, some outlying suburbs of Hobart at higher elevation can receive snowfall. The nearby Mount Wellington is often seen snowcapped during winter, and its temperatures are much colder than Hobart — typically 10 degrees colder and easily reaching below zero during winter.</p>
<p>Airlines serving the airport include Jetstar, Qantas, and Virgin Australia with flights from:</p>
<p>Ground transportation options from Hobart Airport include an airport shuttle operated by SkyBus which meets every arriving flight and serves most accommodation within Hobart. Reservations are not necessary for Hobart bound trips on this shuttle, but are required for the return leg to the airport. A ticket costs $22/38 for adults and $19/35 for children or pensioners for one-way/return trips respectively. Those wanting a faster or more direct option should consider taking a taxi. Depending on traffic the journey should take around 20-25 minutes and cost approximately $38-45. Car rental is also available at Hobart Airport with rental companies including Avis, Bargain Car Rentals, Budget, Europcar, Hertz, Red Spot and Thrifty. All of the car rental offices are just past the arrivals gates on the way to the exit</p>
<p>Hobart has a small airport for the volume of passenger traffic it often accommodates. You'll have no problem finding the cafes, bars, and bookshops that are mandatory airport fare, and a souvenir shop. On the positive side you can expect to get your luggage quickly through onto the conveyor. On the negative side, there isn't enough seating in the departure lounge for a few full flights departing simultaneously. You'll still be walking across the tarmac to get on your flight.</p>
<p>Hobart can be easily reached from all other cities and towns in Tasmania by car. Driving from Launceston via National Highway 1 takes around 2.5 hrs with car hire available from the airport or in Launceston itself. You can also take a car from mainland Australia via Devonport, with a ferry departing nightly from Melbourne. The journey from Devonport takes around 4 hrs.</p>
<p>Hobart offers a beautiful deep-water port with cruise ship berths in the heart of the historic Salamanca area of the city.  Large cruise ships dock at Macquarie Wharf.  Volunteer greeters meet the cruise ships, answer questions, and point the way. The immediate area, which includes Constitution and Victoria Docks, offers shopping for art, crafts, clothing and souvenirs; light snacks and food; fishing boats; a yacht basin; and the maritime museum.</p>

The Daintree Rainforest is a tropical rainforest in the Far North of Queensland. With a landscape and ecosystem that resembles more like that of Southeast Asia's instead of Australia's, the Daintree Rainforest is the world's oldest surviving rainforest that stands today. Parts of the rainforest are protected as part of the Daintree National Park a Queensland national park, though many of the rainforest's attractions, villages and POIs are outside the national park. In 1988, it was recognised as such and inscribed on the world heritage list as part of the Wet Topics of Queensland.</p>
<p>The rainforest itself meets all the four natural criteria for selection to be a World Heritage Site, although it is just part of the Wet Tropics site which is one of only twelve natural World Heritage Sites which fulfill all four criterion. The Daintree Rainforest is bordered to the Great Barrier Reef on its coastline, which is another World Heritage site making it the only place in the world where two natural World Heritage Sites meet.</p>
<p>Although there is no well defined border, it's generally said that it starts at the settlement of Mossman and continues up till Bloomfield, but regardless of where the borders are, the rainforest has many options for visitors. The more southerly Mossman Gorge tends to be more accessible and therefore more crowded, but the northern section near Cape Tribulation is the heart of the rainforest, but less accessible and therefore gets less visitors. Nevertheless, both sections are unique experiences.</p>
<p>The Daintree Rainforest is extremely ancient; it is thought to be over 135 million years old. About 430 species of birds live among the trees. The primitive flowering plants Austrobaileya scandens and Idiospermum australiense are also endemic to the Daintree.</p>
<p>As part of the 450 km long Wet Tropics of Queensland coastline between Townsville and Cooktown, the park has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1988. More than 75 percent of the 1,200 km2 (460 sq mi) area consists of tropical rainforest and is considered an exceptional example of ecological evolution and biological diversity.</p>
<p>The rainforest was named by Scottish explorer George Dalrymple after the Australian geologist and photographer Richard Daintree (1832-1878).</p>
<p>The rainforest has not had many controversies in the recent past, but in 1983, the controversial Bloomfield Track was constructed between Cape Tribulation and the Bloomfield River through coastal rainforest, drawing international attention to the rescue, which eventually culminated in a local campaign of blockades by activists. Although the conservationists ultimately lost the battle for the road, this led to a rethink at the federal level of the previously practiced toleration of commercial logging.</p>
<p>Daintree is about 3 hours north of Cairns, 1-2 hours north of Port Douglas (PD). It is much quieter than either Cairns or PD, owing to the distance, crossing the Daintree river (a ferry may take cars and buses across, for a toll), conservation efforts and being off the power grid. The Daintree region is in flux regarding conflicting demands of population and economy growth and preservation of the spectacular natural environment.</p>

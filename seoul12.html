<p>Post offices are basically everywhere in Seoul, although many are hidden on smaller roads and alleys. If you cannot spot any post office nearby, it is good idea to visit university (most university has its own post office in it). The Korean postal insignia is orange and white. It can be spotted on post office signs. Most post offices sell boxes and packing materials. Even the smaller offices typically have at least one English-speaking member of staff.</p>
<p>Useful contact numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>Seoul is a remarkably safe city despite its size, comparable in safety to Hong Kong or Tokyo. Pickpocketing is not very common and violent crime is very rare. There are very few places where CCTV cameras are absent.</p>
<p>If you happen to be a non-Korean man walking hand-in-hand with a Korean woman, drunk older Korean men might give you a tongue lashing or occasionally worse. This is far less of a problem than it used to be.</p>
<p>If you do end up in a fight, remember that Korean law is possibly different from your home country. You may not have legal protection just because someone else started the fight if the attacker ends up hurt.</p>
<p>Do not try to use drones to take pictures in Seoul, because most of the city (especially north of Han river) is a restricted flight area. </p>
<p>U.S. military personnel have a curfew 01:00-05:00 every day on the Korean Peninsula, although the curfew can be extended at very short notice. If you are a Westerner, the American military police have the legal right to request to see your ID and arrest you if you cannot provide it. (This is done to catch American military personnel breaking curfew.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, crimes by American soldiers against Koreans do happen, and when they do they often receive a huge amount of national attention. If you are a Westerner then you should exercise some extra care when such a case hits the media, although it is still highly unlikely you would be in any danger.</p>
<p>Protesting: Large scale demonstrations in Seoul against the government happen from time to time. Often they can result in violence where there are pitched battles between protesters and combat police. People do get seriously hurt, so try to avoid getting too close to the action.</p>
<p>Fake monks have been known to operate in Seoul, notably around the Jogyesa temple. They are dressed as Buddhist monks requesting donations from people on the street in return for blessings, although they do not actually belong to any Buddhist order and just keep the cash for themselves. Actual monks would never seek donations in this manner. If you want to donate money, put into the donation box in temples.</p>

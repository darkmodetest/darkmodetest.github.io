<p>Brisbane has a sizeable rail network. Most services are through-running, travelling from one side of the city to the other. All trains stop at Bowen Hills, Fortitude Valley, Central and Roma Street, regardless of their origin or destination. Interurban services run between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, with connecting tram services at Helensvale. Interurban services also run between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, with connecting bus services at Landsborough. Trains generally run from 6AM to midnight, running later on Friday and Saturday nights, and finishing earlier on Sundays.</p>
<p>Brisbane has a large interconnected network of bus routes that service the whole city. The bus fleet is the most modern in Australia and can be identified by the vibrant blue and yellow colouring. All buses have a digital display of their route number and a brief description of the terminus and/or areas serviced. Most routes run frequent services from 6AM to 11PM at a minimum.</p>
<p>Brisbane's "busways" are dedicated bus rapid transit corridors that provide high frequency routes between the northern, southern, eastern and western suburbs. Most busway routes stop at Roma Street, King George Square, Cultural Centre and South Bank. The busways interchange with the rail network at Roma Street and South Bank, and the two modes of transport combined provide very good coverage of the city.</p>
<p>In some of Brisbane's notoriously dispersed outer suburbs, services may be much less frequent or have reduced running hours, so it is advisable to check timetables if making these trips. Timetables are sometimes optimistic, especially during morning and afternoon peak hours when traffic is heavy, and buses are occasionally up to 10 minutes late.</p>
<p>As with many cities, Brisbane has a large number of express buses, so it should not be assumed that all buses observe every stop along the roads they travel. In peak hour there are even more express routes ("rockets" and "bullets") for commuters which make very few stops at all. Ask the driver if you are unsure.</p>
<p>All-night bus services known as 'NightLink' are operated on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
<p>The following routes are convenient for travel around the inner city:</p>
<p>Ferries have become an icon of the city and are a fantastic way to tour Brisbane along the river.</p>
<p>The CityCat is a high-speed catamaran service that travels up and down the river between Northshore Hamilton and UQ St Lucia. Popular stops include New Farm Park, Howard Smith Wharves, Riverside, South Bank, North Quay and West End.</p>

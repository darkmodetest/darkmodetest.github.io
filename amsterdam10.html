Car parking is very expensive in Amsterdam and it's often hard to find a place to park. You can choose to pay by the hour or for the whole day. Parking is free outside the centre on Sunday—there is always a spot available on the Albert Cuypstraat (which is a market during the rest of the week). From there, it is a 5-minute tram ride or 15 minutes walk to the city centre.</p>
<p>You can park for free in some parts of Amsterdam outside the city centre though this is slowly changing. Parking is still free in some areas in Noord, and you can take the bus from the Mosplein stop to the city centre easily. Plenty of buses run through here. Another option is to park your car far outside the city centre at a Park and Ride facility. For €8 you get a full day (24 hr) of parking and a return ticket to the city centre. The ride takes about 15 minutes. Look for the P+R signs.</p>
<p>Popular car rental chains operate in a smaller capacity in Amsterdam, including Avis and Budget. Car 2 Go has all-electric smart cars available within and around the city.</p>
<p>Ice skating is a longstanding tradition in the Netherlands, and you will sometimes see locals skating down the canals when they freeze over in the winter. However, the ice has to be thick enough for you to be able to do this safely, and this requires temperatures to stay below -5°C continuously for at least 2 weeks. Take the cue from the locals, and only skate when you see large numbers of locals doing so. Also, be particularly careful near bridges as the ice tends to be thinner there. If you see the locals avoiding a particular area, you should too.</p>
<p>Amsterdam has one of the largest historic city centres in Europe, with about 7,000 registered historic buildings. The street pattern has been largely unchanged since the 19th century—there was no major bombing during World War II. The centre consists of 90 islands linked by 400 bridges, some of them beautifully lit at night.</p>
<p>The inner part of the city centre, the Binnenstad, dates from medieval times. The oldest streets are the Warmoesstraat and the Zeedijk in the Oudezijde of the Binnenstad. As buildings were made of wood in the Middle Ages, not many of this period's buildings have survived. Two medieval wooden houses did survive though, at Begijnhof 34 and Zeedijk 1. Other old houses are Warmoesstraat 83 (built around 1400), Warmoesstraat 5 (around 1500) and Begijnhof 2-3 (around 1425). The Begijnhof is a late-medieval enclosed courtyard with the houses of beguines, Roman Catholic women living in a semi-religious community. Beguines are found in Northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and north-western Germany. House number 34 at the Begijnhof is the oldest home in Amsterdam. Entry to the courtyard and surrounding gardens is free, but be careful not to disturb the local community still living here.</p>

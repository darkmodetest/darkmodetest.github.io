The closest one to the city is Glenelg, but there are some in Port Adelaide or Outer Harbor too.</p>
<p>There is a choice of backpacker accommodation around the central bus station. Popular districts for these include parts of the CBD and in some of the southern and northern outer suburbs of Adelaide.</p>
<p>As always, your best bet of finding a choice of mid-range accommodation is the CBD (both the city and North Adelaide), often connected to Victoria Square by public transport. Sometimes a cheaper motel-style accommodation can be obtained on the roads leading into Adelaide. Outside the CBD, most accommodation found will likely be mid-range, but the prices may be slightly lower with more facilities.</p>
<p>Adelaide has the usual splurge chains such as Hilton or Novotel, mostly concentrated in the CBD. Luxury hotels can be found throughout Adelaide, but in particular, the city and West Adelaide are worth checking out â€“ the former for convenience, and the latter for its beach views.</p>
<p>The Australia-wide emergency number is 000. The ambulance service, fire service and police are available through this number.  For non-emergency police assistance, dial 131 444.</p>
<p>Adelaide is considered a safe city, and much more so than other mainland Australian capitals. People should however exercise personal safety, particularly at night. Most violent crime in Adelaide is fuelled by alcohol, so be vigilant and avoid any confrontations if you are in the bars or nightclubs at night.</p>
<p>The city parklands are poorly lit and are best avoided after dark due to the presence of intoxicated people. If you need to cross the parklands to reach the suburbs, stay near the road. Catching a taxi or public transport is recommended at night.</p>
<p>Trains in Adelaide are generally reliable and arrive and depart on schedule. (Buses can be slightly more variable.) There are security guards on all trains after 7PM and many rail services have bus connections available.</p>
<p>At night, police actively patrol the city centre, especially Hindley Street, the latter being where many of the city's nightclubs and bars are. Taxi ranks are near the Adelaide Casino on North Terrace, the Hilton Adelaide Hotel on Victoria Square, and the junction of Rundle Street and Pulteney Street outside the Hungry Jacks fast food outlet. Most regular public transport services end before or at midnight, but special After Midnight bus services operate Saturday night only, travelling from the city to brightly-lit points throughout Adelaide's suburbs.</p>
<p>Adelaide occasionally experiences earthquakes, but these are usually minor and rarely cause major damage.</p>
<p>Adelaide's remote location in the world's driest continent means that all of its drinking water is sourced from the River Murray or local reservoirs. Although the water is perfectly safe to drink, it does make tap water unpalatable to those not used to it and is best drunk filtered.</p>
<p>There is extensive free Wi-Fi access (port 80 only) in the CBD and the airport provided by Internode.</p>

Pay attention to local notices</p>
<p>Darwin has numerous clubs and bars. Also you can check out some local music at Brown’s Mart.</p>
<p>Warning! book ahead in dry season as accommodation gets VERY full.</p>
<p>In an emergency dial 000 for ambulance, fire or police.</p>
<p>Take care at night. While the tourist areas around the waterfront are pretty friendly, there are some rough areas in the city proper. Darwin has consistently been ranked as Australia's most dangerous city, with a crime rate similar to Tripoli (according to Numbeo). Avoid walking alone at night; the most common types of crime are break-ins, car vandalism, theft, knife crime, and pickpocketing, much of which is alcohol-fueled. Take extra care of your belongings and around bottle shops – don't leave any valuables unattended.</p>
<p>Royal Darwin Hospital is one of five public hospitals located within the Northern Territory. The hospital is on Rocklands Drive, Tiwi, on the northern side of Darwin. As you approach Casuarina, blue signs give directions to the hospital, but it is better to familiarise yourself with the Hospital's location before you may need to find it. Darwin Private hospital is situated across the road. Extensive delays may occur for treatment of anything other than very serious illness or trauma injuries at the Accident and emergency section of Royal Darwin Hospital. Be prepared for a long wait, especially on weekends.</p>
<p>Drink plenty of water; at least 1 litre of water for every hour of walking in very warm weather. Ensure you have an adequate fitness level for the bushwalk you plan to undertake.</p>
<p>Avoid walking in the hottest part of the day or walking alone, register with the overnight bushwalking register if you plan an extended walk. Carry a map of the area you're walking/camping in and know how to read it, tell someone your plan and when you expect to return. Carry a mobile telephone if in a potential coverage area but do not expect coverage anywhere other than very built up areas with good line of sight to a transponder tower. Under no circumstances should you rely on mobile telephony for essential communications unless within the city area. Ensure you are using a mobile telephone service that provides usable coverage in the Northern Territory. Not all of the service providers give even faintly adequate coverage throughout the Darwin area and much less so outside the immediate city and suburban area. Please see the Driving in Australia article for some useful tips that apply to travelling by road in the Northern Territory. Even locations very nearby to the city can present serious challenges and concerns unless properly skilled and prepared for the conditions. The effects of hot weather and exhaustion can set in quickly if you encounter difficulties. Even if you are successful in raising an alarm for assistance it may still be a long wait before it can arrive.</p>
<p>Malaria is not endemic in Australia. During the peak of the dry season (which is the preferred traveling season), mosquitoes are still present in areas where there is water. Bring a DEET-based repellent, as this will also work on sandflies.</p>

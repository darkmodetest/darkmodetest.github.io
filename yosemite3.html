Visitors will most commonly experience the park's extensive coniferous forest, but will also be drawn to the isolated groves of giant sequoias, the largest trees in the world. At elevations above 8,000 ft (2,400 m) beautiful subalpine meadows flower during July and August, while the treeline ends at 9,500 ft (2,900 m) and the vegetation is limited to hardy plants that bloom quickly during the few snow-free months.</p>
<p>Weather can change rapidly during all seasons of the year, and will also vary greatly with elevation. When visiting it is wise to pack for any season with clothing that can be layered, ready to peel off or add on as conditions dictate. Always include some kind of rain gear; the park receives most of its precipitation in the winter months, but storms are common during the transitional spring and fall seasons, and spectacular thunderstorms may occur during summer.</p>
<p>For Yosemite Valley and Wawona (subtract 10-20°F (5-10°C) for Tuolumne Meadows), average weather is as follows:</p>
<p>Warning: There are no gas/petrol stations in the Yosemite Valley!</p>
<p>There are four major entrances into the park. All of these routes are relatively winding mountain roads and appropriate time should be budgeted for them.</p>
<p>A secondary entrance exists to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir exclusively (no Yosemite Valley access) off of State Route 120 from the west. It requires taking a side road near the main Route 120 west entrance of Yosemite. Hetch Hetchy has restricted hours for access due to security for the Reservoir.</p>
<p>During the snow season, usually November through March, snow chains may be required. Chain requirements are strictly enforced in Yosemite with potential fines being as much as $5,000, so chains should be carried during those months.</p>
<p>During summer months traffic becomes heavily congested in Yosemite Valley, and parking can be nearly impossible to find. Summer visitors to Yosemite Valley are therefore strongly encouraged to use the YARTS shuttle system (see below) to get into the park.</p>
<p>There are no landing strips within the park. Airports in surrounding communities include:</p>
<p>Bay Area airports including San Francisco International Airport (SFO IATA), Oakland International (OAK IATA), and San Jose International (SJC IATA) are much larger than any of the above airports and have more frequent flights to more destinations. Driving distance from the Bay Area is approximately four hours. However, landing at SFO requires crossing one of the San Francisco Bay bridges which are usually congested during the morning and evening rush hour. (Likewise for the return flight, and this direction includes a toll booth.) Sacramento International airport (SMF IATA), north of Sacramento, is another large airport option that is also about a four-hour drive from the park. Visitors arriving from the east may choose Reno/Tahoe International (RNO IATA) in Reno, which is about 3½ hours (by car) from the Tioga Pass Entrance (summer only). Combining a flight to a major airport with an Amtrak or Greyhound ride can be an affordable and scenic option.</p>

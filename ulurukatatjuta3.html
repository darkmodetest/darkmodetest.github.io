<p>The road from the Stuart Highway makes for a pleasant & relatively easy cycle tour, undertaken each year by dozens of travellers. Bicycle travellers need to be well prepared in terms of mechanical reliability, water & food, and will need to "bush camp" several nights at least.</p>
<p>Uluru is sacred to the Anangu people of the area and the former climb followed the track that their ancestral Mala men took to get to the top for ceremony. In addition, there were safety and environmental concerns: more than 30 people died while climbing Uluru, the lack of toilet facilities led to pollution of the area, the erosion caused by visitors climbing Uluru damaged it.</p>
<p>As a result, climbing Uluru has been banned since October 2019.</p>

You must purchase a pass to enter the park. As of 2022, passes cost:</p>
<p>Some tours include the fee, ask your booking agent.</p>
<p>You can also purchase the pass at the entrance to the park, but if taking tours, book online as the tour operators will want to check the pass when boarding the bus and not stop at the gate.</p>
<p>3 day passes can be extended for an additional 2 days at the entrance to the park only.</p>

<p>The big rocks are actually a little distance from Yulara, where the accommodation and facilities are.  If you are not with a tour, or didn't bring your car, you will need to decide how best to get to these locations.  Rental cars can be expensive, and have limited kilometres; however shuttles to and from the rock are also expensive, so do the maths and see what works best for you.</p>
<p>Both Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are extremely popular photography subjects and the park provides a general guide to photography. You might also look out for the rare ability to photograph rain in the park, and the possibility of astrophotography given the excellent view of the Milky Way and the lack of light pollution.</p>
<p>Before photographing Uluṟu close up, review the sensitive cultural sites that the Anangu people ask not be photographed. These are marked on the base walk prominently with signs asking that you not take photographs starting from the sign. These are also shown in the photography guide above. The entire north-east face, which is the side visible from the airport and Yulara, should only be photographed from a distance.</p>
<p>Commercial photography requires a permit and drone photography is forbidden.</p>
<p>Two operators provide sightseeing flights over the park, both short flights over Uluṟu and longer flights taking in one or more of Kata Tjuṯa, Lake Amadeus, and Kings Canyon.</p>
<p>Souvenirs are available at the Cultural Centre or at several shops in Yulara. They range from standard shirts, caps and knick-knacks to authentic (and, accordingly, expensive) Anangu art. Food, drinks and photographic equipment are available in Yulara.</p>
<p>Water! And lots of it. No alcohol is sold outside of Yulara, and tribal elders have asked visitors not to sell or give alcohol to the indigenous people.</p>

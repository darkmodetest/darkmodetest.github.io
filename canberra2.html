These town centres are Belconnen and Gungahlin to the north, and Molonglo Valley, Tuggeranong, Woden and Weston to the south, while there are a few towns and villages outside the metropolitan area but still inside the ACT. The ACT also has surrounding towns, such as Murrumbateman, which boasts a strong cool-climate wine selection. The historic villages of Tharwa and Hall are also on the outskirts of Canberra.</p>
<p>The traditional owners are the Ngunnawal, Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples. Much of Canberra's 450,000 population have moved here to study or take up employment with the Australian Federal Government.  A common pattern is that people from other parts of Australia move to Canberra, study or work for a few years and then return to their place of origin or move on to elsewhere. There are many government contractors who just stay during the week, and even longer-term residents may have a regular weekend home elsewhere in the country.</p>
<p>Census data points to Canberra and the ACT as having the highest proportion of same-sex couples in the country – making it an excellent candidate for being Australia's "rainbow capital".</p>
<p>While Canberra has a reputation as a cold city, it can get just as hot as anywhere else in Australia during the summer months, with temperatures above 30°C a frequent occurrence from December through to March. Winter days can be bitterly cold  (June–August) owing to the city's altitude being part of the Australian Alps and proximity to the Snowy Mountains.  Overnight temperatures in winter frequently drop below zero and tend to hover slightly above 10°C during the day. However, it is usually a clear, brisk cold, and rarely a dull, damp cold.  It almost never snows in Canberra, because the below freezing temperatures (at night) usually coincide with clear skies. Most Canberrans believe that late Autumn (mid-April to May) has the city's best weather. Spring weather can be highly changeable.</p>
<p>Canberra is less humid than Australian coastal cities. The hottest days are often mitigated by welcome, cooling, mountain breezes, particularly towards the end of the day, and the temperature drops overnight. Bring a light pullover or jacket when visiting in Summer as the nights can be surprisingly cool. Layered clothing, which can be adjusted to fit the changing temperature during the day, is particularly effective.</p>

<p>Canberra Airport is sometimes affected by morning fog from around May to September, causing delays or cancellations. Many Canberrans avoid morning flights if they can at this time of year, and travellers will probably want to do the same. Aircraft parked at the airport overnight can generally fly out through fog, so early departures are normally unaffected. However, arrivals and subsequent departures can be delayed even after the fog lifts, typically by about 10AM.</p>
<p>-35.3072149.19081 Canberra Airport (CBR  IATA). It serves Australia's capital city, and many nearby towns across the border in New South Wales.   </p>
<p>Major airlines serving the airport are Fiji Airways, Jetstar[dead link], Qantas, Regional Express, and Virgin Australia with flights from all Australian state capitals, as well as Nadi, which is a convenient stopover for those travelling from the Americas and the Pacific. Otherwise, Sydney Airport is the closest gateway airport with flights from many worldwide destinations, but also consider Melbourne as an alternative with easier terminal transfers.</p>

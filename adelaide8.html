<p>Cabs in South Australia are white (even those operated by 'Yellow Cabs') and they are clearly marked. It is generally possible to hail a taxi in the street or from a major hotel during business hours in the City, but in the suburbs you typically need to call one of the company booking services listed. There are a number of cab ranks which are staffed by the Taxi Council at night on weekends. Supervised taxi ranks offer extra security with lights and supervision by a concierge and a security officer. They operate 11PM-3AM on Fridays and 11PM-5AM on Saturdays. A map of locations is available on their website.</p>
<p>All taxis in Adelaide are required by the State Government to charge a regulated metered tariff, according to the time that the journey commences. Tariff one is the normal tariff rate and tariff two is a higher rate that applies between Monday to Friday 7PM-6AM, and on weekends and public holidays. Drivers almost always use the meter and are legally required to do so. Payment can be made by cash, EFTPOS, debit and credit cards and Cabcharge. It's a good idea to let the driver know if you are planning to pay with a method other than cash before you start your trip, as the machines can be unreliable.</p>
<p>Adelaide's city centre and inner suburbs like Glenelg, Norwood and Prospect are easily traversed walking and using public transport. However, if you are expecting to spend a lot of time outside the city centre or you are planning a trip to a wine region, a car is useful to avoid long trips on public transport. Major national rental car companies operate kiosks at Adelaide Airport on the ground floor near baggage claim.</p>
<p>All of Adelaide's roads as well as those throughout South Australia are toll-free. Unlike other Australian state capitals, Adelaide does not have a network of freeways leading directly into the city centre. The freeways that exist begin in the outer suburbs and are for the purpose of carrying traffic to the nearby country towns.</p>
<p>Speed limits on most major roads are signposted at 60 km/h, though the default speed limit is 50 km/h if no speed limit is posted. Speed limits are strictly enforced, and even creeping ever so slightly above the speed limit may earn you a ticket with a $350 fine.</p>
<p>Adelaide is a good city to travel around by bicycle, and most local motorists are courteous and accommodating to cyclists. Outside the City and North Adelaide, most main roads have dedicated cycling lanes, and many locals commute to work by bicycle. Bicycle lanes are not as common in the City and North Adelaide, but can still be found on specific streets. Bicycles can be taken on trains (but not on trams or buses). A peak concession fare is required on Monday to Friday before 9AM and between 3-6PM (except for Seniors Card members). All other times bicycles can be taken for free.</p>

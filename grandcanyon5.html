The park service runs a shuttle during this time.  The shuttles are frequent but long lines form during the busy summer months.</p>
<p>Between the North and South Rims, there is no easy connection.
By shuttle bus (for a fee), Trans-Canyon Shuttle offers a seasonal daily rim-to-rim shuttle, which runs from rim to rim, through Vermillion Cliffs, with a stop at Marble Canyon.
By car, the shortest route is a five-hour drive around the east of the canyon and crossing the river by a bridge near Lees Ferry.
By foot, it is a two-day hike across the canyon.</p>
<p>There are several other viewpoints along the road between Hermit's Rest and Grand Canyon Village (West Rim) or Desert View and the village (East Rim).</p>
<p>10 mi (16 km) from the South Rim by air, is the 36.2105-112.06135 North Rim. The North Rim is a 215 mi (346 km), 5-hr drive from Grand Canyon Village. At 8,000 ft (2,400 m) the elevation of the North Rim is approximately 1,000 ft (300 m) higher than the South Rim, and as a result it features more coniferous trees and cooler temperatures. The roads to the North Rim are open only during the summer (from about 15 May to the first fall snowfall), while the in-park facilities usually close by 15 Oct, regardless of the weather. With far fewer visitors, this area can be a great place to enjoy the peace and majesty of the canyon. The main viewpoints are Bright Angel Point, Cape Royal (where the Colorado River can be seen), and Point Imperial (the highest viewpoint in the park).</p>
<p>36.1529-112.64036 Supai and its waterfalls, part of the Havasupai Indian Reservation, are a popular destination that lie southwest of the park's Grand Canyon Village.</p>
<p>Havasu Canyon is subject to flash floods. Some areas remain off-limits to visitors due to flooding in the 2018 and 2019 seasons.</p>
<p>Havasupai can be loosely translated as "People of the Blue-Green Water". Entry into this remote portion of the canyon requires an entry permit, purchased in advance. Entry permits are $110 per person, and are only available to those people with reservations at either the Lodge (an additional $440 per room per night) or the campground ($300 to $375 per person for a required three night reservation, which includes the permit fee); day hikes are not allowed. Full payment is due when campground reservations are made; transfers may be offered on the Havasupai website for a ten percent fee. Lodge reservations require a $100 per night deposit, and may be cancelled up to two weeks in advance. Those venturing into Havasu Canyon are greeted by spectacular world class waterfalls.  Although the Havasupai Reservation is somewhat impacted (trashy), the incredible canyon below the village of Supai is worth the visit.  Access to Havasu Canyon is from Hualapai Hilltop north of Peach Springs, in Route BIA 18 (also known as Hualapai Hilltop Highway; no services along this route).  Visitors must park at Hualapai Hilltop and hike or fly to Supai Village near the waterfalls. It is an 8 mi (13 km) hike to Supai Village and a further 2 mi (3.2 km) to the campground. Helicopter transportation to and from the village is available on a first come basis four days a week (to fly from the village to the hilltop, sign up early in the morning). On occasion the wait may be many hours in length; service may terminate due to high winds, at which time you would still need to hike out. An extremely rustic lodge is the only public accommodation available in Supai. A large mile long campground is 1 mi (1.6 km) down canyon between Havasu and Mooney Falls.  Both the campground and the lodge are extremely crowded most of the year; advance reservations are a necessity, and are very difficult to obtain. A hike further north from the end of the campsite (Mooney Falls) to the Colorado River is a further 8 mi (13 km), which will often have you bushwacking and in the water.</p>

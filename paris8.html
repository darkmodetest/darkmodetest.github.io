If you ask the locals about directions, they will answer something like: take line number n towards "end station _", change at "station _", take the line nn towards "end station _" etc. The lines are also colour-coded.</p>
<p>Changing metro lines might be difficult at times for visitors travelling to or from the airport or train stations with heavy luggage or those with impaired mobility, especially at major metro intersections. Moving from one platform to another generally involves walking up and down multiple flights of stairs. Very few stations have elevators (only the newest line 14 is wheelchair-accessible at all stations). Only the busiest ones have escalators. It might be a good idea to check out the bus routes and timings and see if one can find a convenient bus connection.</p>
<p>Each station displays a detailed map of the surrounding area with a street list and the location of buildings (monuments, schools, places of worship, etc.,) as well as exits for that particular metro. Maps are located on the platform if the station has several exits or near the exit if there is only one exit.</p>
<p>Except for Métro 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13, and 14, the doors will not open automatically. In such a case, there are handles or buttons located both inside and outside the train that you have to push or unlatch in order to open the door. Many locals may try to squeeze into the trains after the alarm has sounded to signal the closing of the doors. While one can occasionally pass through on lines with a driver, the automatic doors on Métro 1 and 14 will continue to close despite the presence of a limb or article of clothing. It is strongly advised to wait for the second train than to chance being caught between the doors.</p>
<p>Some larger stations have secondary entrances, where there is no ticket booth. These are labelled voyageurs munis de billets (passengers with tickets).</p>
<p>There are five commuter train lines that cross Paris: RER A, B, C, D, and E. RER trains run at intervals varying from about 3 minutes (RER A) to 6 minutes (RER D), and stop at every station within Paris. Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend.</p>
<p>RER trains will stop at every station within Paris (zone 1), but may skip stations outside Paris, so if you're going to the suburbs make sure your RER stops where you need! Information about the stops to be made by the next incoming train is presented on a separate board also hanging from the ceiling.</p>
<p>RER trains do not have publicly announced numbers unlike the rest of SNCF network; the four letter codes (COHI, ELAO, QYAN, VICK, etc.) take the role of the train numbers instead; the first letter indicates the station where the train terminates, and the other three indicate the route and stops. Each line has its own nomenclature. You can look up what these codes mean on information panels in the station, but the easiest and fastest way is often to check the information screens along the platforms.</p>

All buses in all directions leave from this one stop, so check the front of the bus to make sure its heading where you want to go! Realtime bus information is available for this stop and all Adelaide Metro stops or via a range of apps for your smartphone. You don't even need to get a ticket; just tap and pay with your bank card or compatible device.</p>
<p>The JetBus is part of the Adelaide Metro network, so the standard ticket types and fares in the public transport section apply, and a ticket used on the JetBus can be used with another bus, train or tram according to its type. metroCARDs are also available for sale at the airport from a vending machine next to the JetBus stop.</p>
<p>Taxis are available downstairs out the front of the terminal. A taxi to the City costs around $30 during the morning peak hour and around $20 at other times, which can make it as economical as the JetBus for a group. Drivers will always use the meter, but a $2 surcharge is payable in addition to the metered amount for pickups from the airport.</p>
<p>Major national rental car companies operate kiosks on the ground floor near baggage claim. The car rental car park is on the ground level directly opposite the terminal.</p>
<p>Adelaide is at least a day's drive away from the capital cities on the Australian east coast. The shortest driving route from Adelaide to Melbourne takes 8–9 hours (see Overland travel between Melbourne and Adelaide). There are some freeway sections, but the roads are mostly 2-lane roads of highway quality.</p>
<p>From Melbourne, Adelaide is 736 km (457 mi)via Horsham (A8) or 901 km (560 mi) via Mt Gambier (A1/B1). The journey via Mt Gambier takes you through the Coonawarra wine region, one of the most renowned cabernet sauvignon regions in Australia and is also convenient for a side tour via the Great Ocean Road. The trip via Horsham is more direct, but has fewer tourist attractions.</p>
<p>From Sydney, Adelaide is 1,422 km (884 mi) via Wagga Wagga and Mildura (A20).  Freeway conditions from Sydney to Wagga Wagga (the divided highway ends at Tarcutta, but it's only a mere 40 km from there) cut hours from the trip. This route also passes close to Canberra, Australia's national capital, which is 1,196 km (743 mi) from Adelaide.</p>
<p>Another option from Sydney is the 1,659 km (1,031 mi) route via Broken Hill (A32), which takes you through the Outback and one of Australia's most historic mining towns. The 2,031 km (1,262 mi) route from Brisbane also goes via Broken Hill.</p>
<p>While Adelaide is the closest capital city to Perth, the 2,550 km (1,580 mi) journey across the Nullarbor is still arduous, though it's a unique drive through some of the most remote places in the inhabited world. Kalgoorlie–Boulder, another one of Australia's historic mining towns, can be visited on a short detour along this route. Similarly, the 3,027 km (1,881 mi) journey north to Darwin via Alice Springs travels through the true Outback and Uluru is only three hours from the main highway north. However, both these drives are usually drives that ordinary Australians only do about once or twice in their lifetimes.</p>

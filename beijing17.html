Chongwenmen Market (崇文门市场), one of the city's oldest, is a local market offering vegetables and groceries. For tea enthusiasts, Maliandao Tea Street (马连道) is a vast wholesale market that provides a glimpse into China's tea trade, though it’s not a typical tourist spot.</p>
<p>Beijing provides an ideal opportunity to sample food from all over the country. Some of Beijing's best restaurants serve food from Sichuan, Hunan, Guangzhou, Tibet, Yunnan, Xinjiang, and more.</p>
<p>One of Beijing's most famous streets for food is undoubtedly Guijie (簋街/鬼街). This vibrant street, located in the Dongcheng District, is a true haven for food lovers, offering a wide array of excellent cuisines. Stretching over a kilometer, Guijie is home to more than 150 eateries, with around 90% of its commercial spaces dedicated to dining.</p>
<p>As a global city, Beijing offers a rich variety of international restaurants, particularly in the Chaoyang District. The dining scene is centered around Sanlitun and stretches west to the Worker's Stadium, north to the diplomatic area, and south to the Central Business District. In this vibrant area, you can find a wide range of international options, including gourmet burger joints, sandwich shops, and taquerias. Beijing’s strong diplomatic ties to the Global South also bring unique offerings, such as chicken jollof rice from Ghana and BBQ from Pakistan. Within the Sanlitun subdistrict, Xingfucun Zhonglu, a small side street, and a short section of Xindong Lu, a larger main street perpendicular to Xingfucun, is home to the city's most westernized section of dining. Here, you'll find steakhouses, craft beer, bakeries, and coffee shops located close together. April Gourmet, a small grocery store selling imported Western foods, is also nearby. For a quick, cheap bite, Greek Freak, at the corner of Xingfucun and Xindong Lu, serves Greek gyros (36 yuan) and Hungarian goulash (42 yuan).</p>
<p>For a distinct international dining experience, visit Shenlu Jie, located north of Ritan Park, also in the Chaoyang District. This neighborhood, marked by Cyrillic signs, is lined with restaurants serving Central and West Asian cuisines and even features a Russian grocery store. One standout spot is Kavkaz, run by an Azerbaijani entrepreneur, which offers dishes from across the former Soviet Union and boasts the best sheesha in Beijing.</p>

Peking duck (北京烤鸭 Bĕijīng kăoyā) is a famous Beijing speciality served at many restaurants, but there are quite a few restaurants dedicated to the art of roasting the perfect duck. Peking duck is served with thin pancakes, plum sauce (甜面酱 tiánmiàn jiàng), and slivers of scallions and cucumbers. You dip the duck in the sauce and roll it up in the pancake with a few slivers of scallions and/or cucumbers.  The end result is a mouthwatering combination of the cool crunchiness of the cucumber, the sharpness of the scallions, and the rich flavours of the duck.The two best known restaurants are Dadong or Quanjude.</p>

Regular MetroCard is the best option if you are spending a few days in New York and plan to use the subway or bus fewer than 12 times.</p>
<p>You can also get discounted tickets to certain events by showing your MetroCard when purchasing tickets. Current promotions are listed on the MetroCard website</p>
<p>Despite a reputation for being dirty, the subway, which operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week, is the fastest and best way to travel around four boroughs of the city. Unfortunately for people who live there, it doesn't reach Staten Island, which is instead served by a separate railway. Fares are $2.90 (unless you use Single Ride MetroCard, which is $3), regardless of distance traveled. The much-feared subway crimes of the 1970s and 1980s are for the most part a thing of the past, and it is usually completely safe. Just remember to use common sense when traveling late at night alone. Try to use heavily-traveled stations, remain visible to other people, and don't display items of value publicly. While violent crime is rare, petty crime - especially theft of iPhones and other expensive electronics - is very frequent, so be aware when using your phone on the train.</p>
<p>Every subway route is identified by either a letter or a number, not by a color. Therefore, if you ask where the "green line" is, a New Yorker will look at you like you're insane, since the green line is really three different lines. The only reason why some lines are the same color is because in Manhattan, they use the same set of tracks as the other lines colored in that specific color. It may be possible for trains from one line to be diverted to a platform normally intended for another line, especially during weekends and other periods of maintenance work.</p>
<p>PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) trains primarily provide commuter service between urban Northern New Jersey and Manhattan in two branches—one connecting the city of Newark with the World Trade Center and a branch connecting the smaller enclaves of Hoboken and Jersey City with the Herald Square area of Midtown Manhattan. PATH trains can be used to travel within Manhattan along a segment running under Sixth Avenue, although realistically there's no reason to use this service unless the Sixth Avenue subway line ( B  D  F  F  M ) is severely delayed or disrupted. Manhattan PATH stations are cramped and dusty; expect extremely crowded conditions during rush hours. Unlimited Ride MetroCards cannot be used on the PATH. PATH also accepts the SmartLink Card (similar to the MetroCard, but the SmartLink Card cannot be used on the NYC subway), and accepts contactless payment directly using credit cards, smartphone taps, etc at the TAPP gates. Like the subway, PATH operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. PATH trains usually arrive every 5–10 minutes (based on the time of day), but overnight, they may only come every 35 minutes.</p>

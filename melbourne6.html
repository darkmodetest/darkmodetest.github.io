Concessions only apply to Australians with the appropriate concession card. Children aged under 18 can use a concession myki, but 17 and 18 year olds must carry a government-issued ID to prove their age. Myki cards are non-refundable and do not come with preloaded credit. A daily full fare Myki costs $11 onweekdays and $7.60 on weekends. </p>
<p>To use your myki, touch on by holding the card onto a reader before travel at the train station, or on board a bus/tram, and wait for the beep. Touch off when exiting a train station or a bus; touching off on a tram is optional and not recommended. Metropolitan Melbourne has two zones: Zone 1 which covers the entire city, and Zone 2 which allows a cheaper fare when travelling only in the outer suburbs (this will not be relevant for the vast majority of travellers). The fare (including the travel time and zone) is automatically calculated and deducted by myki, so there is no need to plan costs in advance. In the city centre, there is also a Free Tram Zone where one does not require a myki to travel and should not touch on if remaining within the zone. But you do need to touch on your myki if you wish to travel beyond the Free Tram Zone. Touching on your myki inside the Free Tram Zone will result in your myki balance being charged.</p>
<p>On-board myki readers come in two styles. The old style is a bright yellow and blue 'brick' design with a small screen, where the touch-on region is the blue rectangle; nowadays (as of 2021), this style is only seen on trams. The new style, seen on all modern buses, is a large touchscreen display. Older myki readers may take a while to process, and you need to hold the card up against the reader until it beeps, which is why touching off on a tram is not recommended to avoid holding up the people behind you. If you don't touch off, your myki will be charged a standard fare: a 2-hour fare if all of your public transport use has been within 2 hours. If you've been using public transport for longer than 2 hours, you will be charged a daily fare. Many people do not touch off because these default fares are the same as you would be charged anyway. You cannot touch on if your myki balance is negative.</p>
<p>For the first time you touch on each day, Myki calculates a 2-hour fare. If you touch on again, on the same day, more than 2 hours after your first touch on, Myki extends your fare and it becomes a daily fare. This fare is valid on all public transport until 3am the next day.</p>
<p>No matter how much you travel within Melbourne, you will never pay more than the daily fare.</p>
<p>There are a few little-known public transport discounts. The Early Bird discount is aimed at commuters: if you touch on and off before 7:15AM (train journeys only), your myki will not be charged. More useful is the 6PM rule: if you touch on for the first time at 6PM or later, you can travel as much as you like until 3am for the price of a 2-hour fare. Finally, all public transport across Victoria is free from 6pm New Year's Eve until 6AM New Year's Day.</p>

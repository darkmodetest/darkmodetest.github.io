The primary deity is Sanghyang Widi Wasa (Acintya), the "all-in-one god" for which other gods like Vishnu (Wisnu) and Shiva (Civa) are merely manifestations, and instead of being shown directly, he is depicted by an empty throne wrapped in the distinctive poleng black-and-white chessboard pattern and protected by a ceremonial tedung umbrella.</p>
<p>The Balinese are master sculptors. Temples and courtyards are replete with statues of gods and goddesses like Dewi Sri, the goddess of rice and fertility, as well as guardians and protecting demons like toothy Rakasa, armed with a club. These days though, entire villages like Batubulan have twigged onto the tourist potential and churn out everything imaginable from Buddhas to couples entwined in acrobatic poses for the export and souvenir market.</p>
<p>Balinese dance and music are also just as famous and a major attraction for visitors to the island. As on neighbouring Java, the gamelan orchestra and wayang kulit shadow puppet theatre predominate. Dances are extremely visual and dramatic, and the most famous include:</p>
<p>Nyepi is a very special day to the Balinese as this is the day that they have to fool all evil spirits that no one is actually on Bali - hence the need for silence. If this is achieved, then it is believed that the evil spirits will go looking elsewhere for their prey and leave Bali alone for another year. Balinese people are very religious and life is full of ritual. Nyepi is one of the most important days in their calendar.</p>
<p>During this day, all ports of entry are closed from 6AM until 6AM the following day, although emergency services do still open, and absolutely no one may be outdoors or be seen doing anything indoors. If one does choose to observe, fire (which means cooking), entertainment, and anything that uses electricity must be turned off, as is travelling and working; they should instead meditate in silence from sunrise on the day to sunrise on the following day. While your hotel may still open, you will be unable to check in or out on this day, while only food and the bare essential services will run.  All guests will be asked to remain indoors most of the time, and keep the lights and noise to a minimum, so as not to be seen or heard from outside. Wi-Fi, mobile connection, and television may also be off depending on your place of stay.</p>
<p>Nyepi also serves to remind the Balinese of the need for tolerance and understanding in their everyday life. In fact, Hinduism on Bali is unique because it is woven into and around the original Balinese animistic religion. The two now have become one for the Balinese, a true sign of tolerance and acceptance.</p>
<p>Nyepi Dates:</p>
<p>There are an estimated 20,000 temples (pura) on the island, each of which holds festivals (odalan) at least twice a year. With many auspicious days throughout the year there are always festivities going on.</p>

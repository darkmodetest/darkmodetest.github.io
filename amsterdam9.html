Hailing taxis on the street is generally not to be recommended unless you are going to a well-known destination (e.g. Centraal Station or Schiphol). The liberalization of the taxi market in Amsterdam led to an influx of taxi drivers who have little or no clue of where they are going and who drive erratically and dangerously (e.g., driving on bicycle lanes instead of the main road or ignoring red lights). Tourists are advised to stick to public transport if at all possible. Get into a taxi only if you know the route yourself and are able to give directions to the taxi driver and if you know roughly how much the journey ought to cost so you don't get cheated.</p>
<p>Some drivers, traditionally at Centraal Station or Leidseplein, will refuse short trips or will quote outrageously high fares, even though all taxis are metered. Even if you convince the driver to use the meter, he will often take a circuitous route that racks up €15 or more on the meter. For reference, no trip within the historic centre should cost more than €10 or so.</p>
<p>The Netherlands (and Amsterdam) is in the middle of a huge taxi liberalization scheme which has been jarring to all involved. After many missteps, the government has introduced an unusual pricing scheme.  First you feel sticker shock as the initial fare is now €7.50. Luckily, that includes the first 2 km of travel and there is no charge for waiting in traffic. If you need to run in somewhere, you need to negotiate a waiting fee with the driver. 50 cents per minute is customary.</p>
<p>Unlicensed, illegal cabbies operate mainly in Zuidoost. These aren't easily recognized as such, and most certainly don't drive Mercedes cars. They are known as snorders and most easily reached by mobile phone. Rides within Zuidoost (the Bijlmer) range from €2.50 to €5, whereas Zuidoost-Centre can run up to €12.50. Snorders have a shady reputation, so consider their services only if you are adventurous.</p>
<p>Cars are anything but miserable torture only outside the historic centre; within the historic centre, public transport is by far your best bet. In Amsterdam, a car is generally a liability and not an asset, as traffic is dense and parking spaces are quite expensive and very hard to find. Use a car only if you are going to an obscure location many kilometers out that is not served by public transport, or during the less busy times of the day or week, you may want to park near the Centraal Station and take the tram or walk. Driving here is a pain: many of the streets are narrow, the traffic (and parking) signs are baroque and obscure, and cyclists and pedestrians may get in your way. Plus, petrol is about €1.54 to €1.7 per liter.</p>
<p>Parking on the street at the city centre can reach as much as 7.5 € an hour! Luckily there is a cheaper way, specially if you are going to park for more than a couple of hours. Mobypark is a shared parking platform where you can find and book parking in the centre of Amsterdam as well as some great P+R location like RAI Amsterdam</p>

GVB tickets are not valid on trains or Connexxion bus 197 to Schiphol Airport. You can use them on GVB bus 69 to Schiphol but it's quicker to get there by train.</p>

<p>There are five metro lines in Amsterdam, including a short underground section in the city centre, that serves the suburbs. It takes 15–20 minutes from Centraal Station to Zuid or Bijlmer-ArenA in Zuidoost.</p>
<p>The 5th metro line, the Noord/Zuidlijn (North–south line), finally opened on July 21, 2018. It's an underground metro line that connects the north of Amsterdam directly with the south of the city through the city centre, hence the name.</p>
<p>The tram network has 14 lines and it is considered the major carrier in the central area of the city. Amsterdam Centraal is the largest hub of the tram system with 8 tram lines terminating there. 52.3634944.8815957 Leidseplein is the next largest hub with 6 tram lines passing through. Tram lines 5 and 25 serve the neighbouring municipality of Amstelveen, and tram line 19 serves the neighbouring municipality of Diemen. Many metro stations provide connections with nearby tram lines.</p>
<p>All tram stops have a detailed map of the system and the surrounding area. You can also get a free public transport map at the GVB ticket office (just outside Amsterdam Centraal).</p>
<p>Most trams these days have conductors, near the rear of the tram. Board by the driver or the conductor. If you have questions, the conductor will be sure to respond to your query. You can buy 1-hour, 24-hour, and 48-hour tickets from the conductors.</p>
<p>Just like the tram and metro, local buses are operated by the GVB. There are also suburban buses to nearby towns such as Haarlem and Uithoorn; these are operated by Connexxion or EBS (the company name and house style is prominent on the bus side) and can be used within Amsterdam if you travel with an OV-chipkaart. Enter buses only via the front door. Generally, almost all bus routes operate very frequently throughout the week.</p>
<p>There are several ferry services across the IJ river, between the city centre and Noord, the most frequent runs every 7 minutes. They all leave from a new jetty on the northern (rear) side of Amsterdam Centraal. All ferries are free of charge and provide nice views of the harbour and skyline.</p>
<p>The nicest one is the 15-min service to the NDSM-werf, a funky, up and coming, industrial neighbourhood with a nice cafe-bar (IJkantine), restaurant (Noorderlicht), indoor skateboard park, and the Pancake Boat (Pannenkoekenboot) which sails many times each week. Ferries leave every 30 minutes from Amsterdam Centraal and from the NDSM-werf. Double frequencies during rush hours.</p>
<p>You can also hop on the ferry to Buiksloterweg, and then make a short walk to the EYE Film Institute for its architecture and free exhibition in the basement.</p>

The earliest evidence of settlements in the area of what is now Berlin are a wooden rod dating from approximately 1192 and remains of wooden houses dated to 1174 which were found in a 2012 excavation in Berlin Mitte. The first written records of towns in the area of present-day Berlin date from the late 12th century. Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Köpenick in 1209, although these areas did not become part of Berlin until 1920 (see below). </p>
<p>The nucleus of Berlin was two towns: Berlin (now known as the Nikolaiviertel close to Alexanderplatz), which began as a Slavic town, and Cölln, which was Germanic in origin, which included what has today become the Museum Island. While the etymology of "Berlin" is not fully clear (the bear in the coat of arms is due to an understandable wrong assumption medieval German speakers made) it is likely linked to a Slavic word for swamp. So yes, Germany's capital was literally built in a swamp. The year 1237 (first mention of Cölln in official records) is what was used as the basis for the 750-year celebrations in 1987, and it'll likely be used as the reference point for future anniversaries.</p>
<p>The area became known as Berlin-Cölln and was a residence for the electors of Brandenburg, but it remained a relatively small trading post. Roughly half of Berlin's inhabitants perished as a result of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). The war led to a signature Hohenzollern policy of allowing and even encouraging religious refugees to immigrate to the area. The policy was promulgated by "great elector" Frederic William (Friedrich Wilhelm, reigned 1640-1688), who also consolidated the trend of ruling Prussians to be called Friedrich, Wilhelm or both, which lasted all the way to the last German Kaiser Wilhelm II.</p>
<p>Berlin became the capital of Prussia in 1701, but Potsdam remained a symbol for Hohenzollern rule into Weimar times. In 1710 several independent towns were merged into Berlin, helping to give it the polycentric layout it still has. The Prussian leaders of the 18th century were known for their "enlightened despotism" and an amount of religious toleration far beyond that found in other parts of Europe at the time. Those policies benefited all of Brandenburg/Prussia but they had their strongest impact on Berlin.</p>
<p>The German Empire (Deutsches Reich) was formed in 1871 under Prussian dominance and Berlin became the capital of this newly-united Germany. It grew quickly as the political capital and as a centre of industry. Between 1877 and 1900, its population grew from 1 million inhabitants to 1.9 million. In 1884-1885, Berlin was the location of the Berlin Conference, in which the great powers, namely Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States, met to divide Africa among themselves.</p>
<p>In 1918, it was in Berlin that many of the most decisive events of the German November Revolution to overthrow the Kaiser took place. Philipp Scheidemann, a Social Democrat, declared a republic from a window of the Reichstag on 9 November 1918. Just hours later, communist Karl Liebknecht declared a "free socialist republic" leading to a schism between the Social Democrats and Communists, who were already at odds in 1914 over the question of whether to support World War I. Berlin became one of the centres of fighting and chaos. The split continued throughout the Weimar Republic period. </p>

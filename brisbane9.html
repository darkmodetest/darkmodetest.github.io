High concentration of craft beer bars, serving local, interstate and international brews.</p>

<p>Brisbane hotels are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Brisbane City Council now offers free Wi-Fi access in 22 parks and public spaces across Brisbane, as well as the locations around the CBD including Queen Street Mall, Reddacliff Place, Victoria Bridge, South Bank Parklands, Valley Malls, Mt Coot-tha Summit Lookout, Brisbane Libraries and on CityCats. It can be useful to do a quick email, or lookup some info - but the performance can be challenging.</p>
<p>Many cafes and hotels provide free Wi-Fi access to patrons, as do many shopping malls. Keep an eye out for signage (or do a scan for hotspots). McDonald's restaurants have free Wi-Fi, and most Starbucks locations offer free 60-minute access to Wi-Fi with purchase of any drink.</p>
<p>There are also alternatives to cafes:</p>
<p>Payphones are abundant in the downtown area. For Australia wide contact options, such as mobile phones and calling cards, see the entry in Australia</p>
<p>Brisbane has a relatively low crime rate in comparison to other cities of such size. In most cases being aware of your environment and using common sense will keep you safe. Like Sydney and other large cities, trains and train stations are usually considered a common crime zone throughout the afternoons and nights, however trains and stations are patrolled by Police, Transit Officers, railway personnel and private security guards. Cameras are also used to increase security. It is advised to exercise caution when travelling on trains and buses during these periods of the day.</p>
<p>Here are some particular areas of note:</p>
<p>Throughout Australia, the number for emergency services (Police, Fire and Ambulance) is 000. When using a mobile or cell phone, the numbers 000 and 112 are free of charge, and connect using any of the available networks.</p>
<p>Emergency numbers such as 911 and 999 do not work within Australia.</p>
<p>Probably the worst thing that can befall your trip to Brisbane is sunburn and other heat-related issues. The local UV Index is almost always in the extreme rating during the day (10AM-3PM) and precautions should always be taken. Do not be fooled though, even in the cooler months or when it is overcast you can still be affected by UV rays or the heat.  Sunscreen, shirts, sunglasses and lots of water are essential.</p>
<p>The damaging effects of the Queensland sun should not be underestimated. The state has the highest per-capita rate of skin cancer in the world and tourists often come unprepared. On a sunny day in Brisbane, it is common to be sunburnt after as few as 15 minutes under the midday sun, but sunburn can also occur on overcast days. This is not exclusive to summer, but can happen all year round, even in winter.</p>
<p>If you are planning a long day outdoors, always cover up with sunscreen, loose clothing, a hat and sunglasses to protect yourself. Limit your outdoor physical activity in the summer until you are used to the heat. Immediately seek shade or an air-conditioned area and drink plenty of water if you are feeling the effects of heat exhaustion, including headache, nausea, dizziness, fatigue, confusion or fainting.</p>

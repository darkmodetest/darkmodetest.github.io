Follow the signs: move into the left lane and move as far forward as possible, wait and when the traffic signal for the street you are turning into turns green, make the turn.</p>
<p>There are two major tollways in Melbourne, both of which have no manual tollgates and require day passes to be purchased in advance or up to three days after the trip online or over the phone. Registration number and car details should be provided; failure to buy a pass can result in expensive fines, and car rental companies will often stack their own administration charges on top of these. Be aware that major rental companies will often offer a toll option, which is usually cheaper than purchasing your own passes. Tollways are represented by blue and yellow road signage rather than the usual green and white signs. Tollways are clearly signposted and easily avoided if so desired.</p>
<p>CityLink is the T-shaped tollway through the city core, connecting the West Gate Freeway in the west, Monash Freeway in the south-east and Tullamarine Freeway in the north. These freeways are useful for travelling to Geelong and the Great Ocean Road, Phillip Island and Melbourne Airport respectively. A 24-hour pass costs $22.55 for cars, less for motorcycles and more for larger vehicles (2024).</p>
<p>EastLink is a northâ€“south tollway through the eastern suburbs and is useful for reaching Frankston. A one trip pass costs $7.68 for cars (not including fees), less for motorcycles and more for larger vehicles (2024). If you are likely to be using both tollroads, it may be worth purchasing a Melbourne Pass for $5.50 in addition to the regular toll costs depending on the length of the trip. Tags from other Australian cities work on CityLink and the EastLink tollway, but passes do not. At the very end of Eastlink, you'll arrive at an interchange with the Mornington Peninsula Freeway, which continues south to Mornington Peninsula. Eastlink continues south as the Frankston Freeway.</p>
<p>The inner suburbs of Melbourne have a good network of bike paths, plus a generally flat terrain, making pedal-power a great way to take in the city. Most bicycle paths are "shared footways" under the law, although the majority of users in most places are cyclists. This means cyclists should expect to share the path with pedestrians, dog-walkers, rollerbladers, joggers, prams and tricycles. Some trails contain on-road sections (in marked bike lanes). It is illegal to cycle on footpaths or pedestrian crossings, with the only exception when supervising cycling children or when the path is marked or signposted as allowing bikes. Helmets are required by law, as are lights when riding at night. Some bike lanes pass through tram stops - by law, you have to stop before the tram stop if passengers are boarding or alighting the tram. Detailed maps of the bike path network can be found . Bicycles may be taken freely on trains, although there may not be space during the peak. There is more room for bikes in the first and last carriages of trains. Only folding bikes are permitted on trams and buses.</p>

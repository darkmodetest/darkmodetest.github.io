<p>Just like the rest of Australia, coffee culture in Canberra is strong and Canberrans make good use of their cafes, and as such there are cafes nearly everywhere. In most cafes, all the important Australian coffees (such as espresso, flat white or a mocca) plus a couple of additions like hot chocolate are a standard in nearly all cafes. On top of that, many cafes will also typically have what you can expect to find at most bakeries, modified to suit a cafe. However, do be aware that most of what you get in cafes in Canberra can get very sweet.</p>
<p>Australians are generally casual and laid back though it's a bit more formal in Canberra, but still feel free to wear whatever you think suits well. Although most people make an effort to dress up for fancier restaurants, there is no requirement and both restaurants and diners alike are relaxed about dress standards, and so it is quite uncommon to see people wearing jeans at restaurants, especially among the younger generations.</p>
<p>Canberra has had authentic restaurants from every corner of the globe since the early 21st century. Still, it doesn't quite compare to the range found in the Big Four (i.e. Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth), but how much more can you expect from a city of just 400,000? If you're after ethnic food, you need not worry because Dickson Centre or the Dickson Shops in the suburb of Dickson, North Canberra should have you covered. It started out like any other shopping precinct but with the addition of many Chinese restaurants, it eventually earned the title of Canberra's Chinatown. It has since grown and now there are many Asian restaurants in general. There are also a few Indian and Italian restaurants too, but there aren't many, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>Outside Dickson, there isn't really a place where you'd find so many concentrated restaurants with ethnic food. Braddon, Civic and Woden have quite a fair bit, but these are scattered throughout.</p>
<p>As Canberra isn't very large, there are few fine dining options in Canberra. They are generally located Civic, North Canberra and the Parliamentary Triangle. </p>
<p>If you want to make a visit to any one of Canberra's fine-dining restaurants, bookings should be made well in advance, as they do get booked out quite a bit.</p>
<p>With regular days where the temperature hits above 35° during summer, and sometimes even 40 more, what is better to have than a nice cool ice cream. Canberra's ice cream flavours don't exactly match up with the flavours of Sydney, but there are several ice cream parlours where you can just get your fit.</p>
<p>The major chains specialising in ice cream that are generally found throughout Australia can also be found in Canberra, such as Ben & Jerry’s, Oliver Brown or Gelatissimo. The latter of the three has some good gelato ice creams if you're looking for gelato, while Oliver Brown has some good chocolate ice cream. Meanwhile Ben and Jerry is somewhat a standalone shop, because it doesn't really specialise in any particular kind of ice cream. </p>

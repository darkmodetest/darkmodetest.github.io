<p>Beijing has several lesser-known high-speed rail stations that are less crowded and are connected to limited destinations. </p>
<p>In Haidian District, Beijing North Railway Station (北京北站) serves the Beijing-Zhangjiakou High-Speed Railway, with routes to Hohhot, Baotou, and Datong. The station is also the starting point for the  BCR Huaimi  Line and is conveniently located adjacent to Xizhimen subway station. Further north, Qinghe Railway Station (清河站) handles some high-speed trains to Chongli and Hohhot. It also stops at the Badaling section of the Great Wall. The station connects to subway lines  13  and  Changping , as well as the  BCR Huaimi  Line. The west square of the station is accessible via several bus routes, including No. 521, No. 623, and No. 专139. </p>
<p>In Chaoyang District, Beijing East Railway Station (北京东站) primarily serves Chengde, Handan, and Ji County. The  BCR Sub-Central  line provides connecting services to Beijing and Beijing West Railway Station, as well as suburban areas like Tongzhou and Fangshan. Beijing Chaoyang Railway Station (北京朝阳站) caters to northeast-bound trains, with subway access planned for September 2024 and nearby bus connections. Nearby bus routes include No.413, which connects to  14  Dongfeng Beiqiao and  10  Liangma Qiao, as well as No.911, which connects to  6  Qingnian Lu. </p>
<p>In the northern suburb of Shunyi, Shunyi West Railway Station (顺义西站) is a small, less crowded station on the Beijing-Shenyang high-speed route, primarily accessible by taxi due to its distance from the city center.</p>
<p>Foreigners are allowed to rent vehicles while in China, although they will require a driving license issued by the People's Republic of China.</p>
<p>Also, you will need special permission (进京证) for driving a non-Beijing license vehicle into Beijing (anywhere within 6th Ring Road), which is valid for at most 7 days, and can be applied for at most 12 times. You can apply for the permit electronically, or at the checkpoints. It will be checked in security checkpoints along the city border, and you should place the permit at the lower-left corner of the front windshield of your vehicle. Expect some queues and jams at these checkpoints.</p>
<p>Non-Beijing licensed motorcycles are totally forbidden from entering any roads within the 6th Ring Road.</p>
<p>As a tourist, you're unlikely to use inter-province buses since China's extensive and affordable high-speed rail system covers most destinations. Cost differences won't matter even to backpackers on a budget. However, there are still some places where a long-distance bus is necessary to travel between Beijing and other regions. For instance, the Eastern Qing Tombs near the small city of Zunhua lack a high-speed rail station, and the grasslands in far northern Hebei have no train stations, making buses the only option.</p>
<p>There are nine inter-province bus stations listed by Beijing Tourism. Two of these are located at the airports. Daxing Airport Station (大兴机场长途汽车站) primarily serves routes to Tianjin, Baoding, Tangshan, and Langfang. Similarly, Capital Airport Station (首都机场长途汽车站) offers routes to Tianjin, Tanggu, Qinhuangdao, Baoding, Tangshan, Langfang, and Cangzhou.</p>
<p>Other bus stations are spread across different parts of the city. The Liuliqiao Passenger Transport Hub (六里桥长途客运站) is a major transportation center in Beijing, facilitating bus services to various provinces and serving as the main hub for long-distance buses, including those to the grasslands of Hebei. Bawangfen Long-distance Passenger Terminal (八王坟长途客运站) is another key hub, with buses traveling to destinations such as Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Inner Mongolia. Lianhuachi Station (莲花池长途客运站) connects travelers to several provinces, including Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Hubei, offering a wide range of long-distance bus services. Sihui Station (四惠长途汽车站) primarily offers bus services to Northeast China, Hebei, Tianjin, and parts of southern China, including the Eastern Qing Tombs. Xinfadi Station (新发地长途客运站) provides connections to Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Inner Mongolia. Yongdingmen Station (永定门长途汽车站) covers a wide range of destinations, including Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shaanxi. Finally, the Zhaogongkou Passenger Terminal (赵公口长途客运站) offers routes to Tianjin, Shanghai, Shandong, and Shanxi.</p>

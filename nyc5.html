From Jamaica you can take NYC subway lines E, J or Z further into Brooklyn, Queens and onward to the island of Manhattan, with travel time being between 50 and 60 minutes to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan. A faster option for those in the know is the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR); these commuter trains can whisk you from Jamaica to Penn Station in roughly 20-25 minutes. Jamaica is a major hub for LIRR train services — only use this option if you are sure of what you're doing. You don't want to get on the wrong train and end up far from your destination. To add insult to injury, unforgiving conductors on the LIRR will charge you on the spot for incorrect tickets. Best to use this option once you have fully done your research or consulted with a local. LIRR trains are extremely crowded both toward and away from New York City during rush hours. </p>
<p>Traffic can be horrendous at all hours, in all directions. If you are driving or taking a taxi to or from JFK, leave yourself plenty of time to get to or from the airport if going by road. </p>
<p>40.6925-74.16862 Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR IATA). In the state of New Jersey, west of Manhattan, serves as New York's second major international airport, New Jersey's primary airport, and a major hub for United Airlines. It is also the starting point of the world's longest nonstop commercial flight; the flight from Singapore on Singapore Airlines that takes a whopping 19 hours to cover a distance of 9,521 miles (15,323 km).

<p>You can get into New York City by taxi for $50-70. Other taxi companies that run cabs to different destinations are also available from the airport. For a cheaper option, take the train: the NJ Transit commuter rail to New York Penn Station takes about 30 minutes and costs $16.80 each way.</p>
<p>New Jersey Transit Bus #62 and other NJT Buses — The most inexpensive option, New Jersey Transit #62 bus runs from in front of all 3 airport terminals to Newark Penn Station (one-way fare $1.80; exact change only; 25 min). From there, you may take a PATH subway train ($2.75) either to World Trade Center station in lower Manhattan (25 min), or, to Journal Square, where you can transfer to the Journal Square-33rd St train across the platform, which runs to the following stops along 6th Ave: Christopher St in Greenwich Village, 9th St, 14th St, 23rd St, and 33rd St. Plan on 90 minutes including waiting times. The #62 Bus operates 24/7 between Elizabeth and Newark Penn Station, including holidays. Service generally runs every 10-15 minutes weekdays, 15-20 minutes Saturdays, and 20-30 minutes Sundays, with overnight service every 30 minutes.</p>

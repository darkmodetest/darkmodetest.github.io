As a result, while a car is a great way to tour the park, if visiting the Valley, taking YARTS and the shuttle bus may be a vastly better option. Be aware that the Tioga Pass Road and the road to Glacier Point are seasonal and close as soon as the first major snow falls. Other park roads may close during storms, but in general are always open. The speed limit in all areas of the park is fairly slow, and is strictly enforced by rangers with radar guns; the speed limits are for your own safety on the twisting mountain roads, as well as for the safety of pedestrians and the many animals that use the area.</p>
<p>The loop road through Yosemite Valley is now one-way. For many years this was a two-lane road, but motorists travelling slowly to admire the scenery often created a long backup of annoyed drivers, so the Park Service converted most of the roads in the valley into one-way roads to allow passing. As a result, when driving in the valley be aware that a wrong turn can send you on a one-way 5 mi (8.0 km) detour.</p>
<p>The one-way routing affects those entering from Oakdale on Hwy 120 the most. You will have to cross over to Southside Drive at the Pohono Bridge. Likewise upon leaving the park, those taking the south exit on Hwy 41 to Fresno also cross the Pohono Bridge, backtrack 1 mi (1.6 km), before turning right onto Wawona Road.</p>
<p>There are three fueling stations in Yosemite. Fuel may be paid for with a credit or debit card 24-hours a day. The stations can be hours away from your location in the park––if you are running even a little low on gas, it's advisable to fill up at the closest station despite regular wait times of 15-20 minutes or more.</p>
<p>There are no stations in the Valley. The nearest to the Valley is Crane Flats, a 16 mi (26 km) drive from Yosemite Village so plan appropriately.</p>
<p> For disabled drivers, an attendant will assist with pumping gas during business hours.</p>
<p>To limit traffic congestion the park service normally runs several free shuttle buses throughout the park (these are not the YARTS system):</p>
<p> The shuttle buses all have wheelchair lifts and tie-downs. Drivers provide assistance.</p>
<p>Yosemite Valley has a network of bicycle paths along its north and south sides. Bikes can be rented for the day at Curry Village & turn a thirty-minute walk into a five-minute ride.</p>
<p>Although the road network covers the most popular sights in Yosemite, the vast majority of the park's area can only be accessed using the park's network of trails. Trails including the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail lead to areas outside of the park's north and south borders.</p>
<p>If you only have a single day to visit the park, a drive around Yosemite Valley is probably the best option. Longer visits provide options for hiking, visiting sites outside the Valley, and getting a fuller experience of what the Sierra Nevadas have to offer. Visiting in winter provides the opportunity to see dramatic winter landscapes in Yosemite Valley or to ski in Badger Pass, but much of the park will be inaccessible due to winter road closures. Spring is the best time to see the waterfalls at their strongest. During the summertime all park roads are open, and Tuolumne Meadows will be snow-free and full of flowers. The Fall offers a time with smaller crowds, cooler weather, and access to the entire park (unless there is an early snowstorm). The vast majority of tourists to Yosemite will spend almost all of their time in Yosemite Valley––returning visitors and experienced travelers alike would be well-served to avoid the valley and explore the rest of the park, which is considerably less developed and trafficked but equally, if not more, beautiful.</p>

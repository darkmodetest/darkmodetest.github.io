Walk up and down Rue des Rosiers to see the variety and choices available from Israeli, Sushi, Italian and others. You will also find a wide assortment of Kosher restaurants in the 9th arrondissement of Paris near the rue Richer and rue Cadet areas. See the district guides for examples. Kosher restaurants and snacks usually display a big orange rectangle on their front, which ensure clients that they are Beth din certified.</p>
<p>For vegetarians, eating traditional French food will require some improvisation, as it is heavily meat-based. That being said, it is far easier to be vegetarian in Paris than it is elsewhere in France. Paris has several excellent vegetarian restaurants, and many non-vegetarian restaurants will provide vegetarian dishes. </p>
<p>When eating in a traditional restaurant, be careful before ordering dishes labelled as "vegetarian". Many French people presume that fish and seafood are vegetarian dishes. This is a widely spread misunderstanding all around the country. Additionally, French people tend to confuse "real" vegetarians with vegans. When explaining that you're a vegetarian that won't eat fish, people will often presume that you don't eat milk or egg-based products.</p>
<p>Look for spots such as Le Grenier de Notre-Dame in the 5th. The 10th arrondissement also has quite a large variety of vegetarian restaurants, especially of Indian and East/South-East Asian fare. See the arrondissement pages for more listings. For fast food and snacks, you can always find a vegetarian sandwich or pizza, or indeed French tacos. Even a kebab shop can make you something with just cheese and salad, or perhaps falafel. And for healthier fare, it's not usually hard nowadays to find hipstery places that sell vegan poke bowls.</p>
<p>There are also lots of Italian, Thai, Indian, and Mezo-American places where you will have little problem. The famous South Indian chain Saravana Bhavan have their branch near Gare Du Nord. In Rue des Rosiers (4th arrondissement) you can get delicious falafel in the many Jewish restaurants. Another place to look for falafel is on Rue Oberkampf (11th arrondissement). Take away falafel usually goes for â‚¬5 or less.</p>
<p>Moroccan and Algerian cooking is common in Paris - vegetarian couscous is lovely. Another good option for vegetarians - are traiteurs, particularly around Ledru Rollin (down the road from Bastille) take away food where you can combine a range of different options such as pomme dauphinoise, dolmas, salads, vegetables, nice breads and cheeses and so on.</p>
<p>Lebanese restaurants and snack shops abound as well, offering a number of vegetarian mezze, or small plates. The stand-bys of course are hummas, falafel, and baba-ganouche (caviar d'aubergine). A good place to look for Lebanese is in the pedestrian zone around Les Halles and Beaubourg in the 1st and 4th.</p>
<p>Also look out for banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) places, especially around Rue Mouffetard in the 5th, where you can often get a tofu banh mi for less than a fiver.</p>
<p>When you are looking for a restaurant in Paris, be wary of those where the staff speak English a bit too readily. These restaurants are usually geared towards tourists. It does make a difference in the staff's service and behaviour whether they expect you to return or not.</p>

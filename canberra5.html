This service is called Capital Link. Services run twice a week (three times a week during Victorian school holidays).  At Bairnsdale a road coach will take you via Orbost, Cann River and Cooma to Canberra, with stops at Canberra Railway Station (Kingston) and the Jolimont Centre (across the road from the City Bus Interchange). Tickets on this service also cost $46.</p>
<p>-35.27738149.128863 Jolimont Centre is the sole coach terminal servicing Canberra, with all coaches stopping here even if they are just passing through Canberra. Located in Civic, the centre itself has limited amenities, including showers, internet access, a few eateries and phones to call the tourist centre and accommodation. Due to its location, it is only a short walk to many hotels or shops and is near the City Interchange, where the light rail terminates and all local busses pass through.</p>
<p>Murrays, ☏ +61 132251, Murrays operate up to 10 daily express services between Sydney (Central Station) and Canberra with extra services on peak days.  They are the main operator on this route. Service takes around 3½ hours. Popular services or last-minute booking is around $51. The service is non-stop (with some services via Sydney International Airport). Murrays also run a daily service from Canberra to Wollongong and Canberra to Narooma. The coaches are more cramped than the trains. Seats are unassigned, so it helps to be there early and not to have luggage to go under the bus, as that lets you get on first and secure your window seat. Buses often fill to capacity, and can experience delays due to peak traffic into and out of Sydney, although the non-stop nature means that they have been known to arrive 10–15 minutes early on a good run.</p>
<p>Greyhound Pioneer, ☏ +61 131499, operate a bus service competing with Murray's. They also offer a direct service to Melbourne. Greyhound's coach services sometimes include video entertainment.  Some Greyhound buses on the Canberra/Sydney route have on-board wifi at no additional cost, but it is very slow and occasionally drops out. The Greyhound services may stop (at passenger request) at Goulburn and at Sydney airport; if this happens, it can introduce significant additional travel time. At busy times, Greyhound sometimes run two services between Canberra and Sydney, one which stops at Sydney airport and another which does not.</p>
<p>NSW Trainlink also run daily buses to and from Eden on the South Coast, via Bega and Cooma.</p>
<p>V/Line, ☏ +61 13 61 96.  V/Line have two services which connect Canberra to Melbourne.  The fastest option is a bus from Canberra to Albury with a connecting train to Melbourne. This takes around 8 hours.  The more scenic option is to travel to Melbourne via Cooma, Sale and Bairnsdale. Likewise, this service connects with a train at Bairnsdale allowing you to continue your journey southwest towards Melbourne.</p>
<p>The drive from Sydney to Canberra is 290 km and takes around three and a half hours from the Sydney CBD, less from outer suburbs in Sydney. The road is a divided-highway, freeway-like conditions from Sydney all the way to Canberra, mostly with a 110 km/h speed limit, via the M5 Southwest Motorway, Hume and Federal Highways. There are three sets of on-road services located on the Hume Highway between Sydney and the turn-off to the Federal Highway to Canberra, as well as many well-maintained and often scenic rest stops with toilets and picnic tables ideal for a picnic.  Take drinks, as the rest areas have no water, or tank water which is not recommended for drinking. A third option which will enable you to see more of the countryside is to stop at one of the small towns in the Southern Highlands on the way, all of which boast many cafes and restaurants open for breakfast, lunch and dinner (but not 24 hour).</p>

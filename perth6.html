Taxi experiences in Perth can range from hassle-free to problematic. Extended waits during peak periods (5-9AM weekdays, and weekend evenings) are common, but outside these times, taxis are plentiful. Booking a taxi is possible but only recommended if your journey is likely to be upwards of $25 or you are travelling to the airport. This is due to the convoluted way in which the dispatch services handle timed bookings. If your journey is likely to be short, it is better to simply call for a taxi once you are ready to leave, or hail a taxi if you are in a busy area.</p>
<p>Three major taxi companies are Swan Taxis (☏ 13 13 30 (domestic)), who dispatch Swan, TriColor, 13CABS, Yellow and Coastal taxis, , Black and White Taxis (☏ 131 008 (domestic)) and Maxi Taxi Perth , they specialise in van taxis with wheelchair hoist and lifts. They also accept all major cards including cabcharge vouchers and Taxi Users Subsidy Vouchers (TUSS vouchers). They strongly suggest that people book online. There are many smaller companies that operate mainly out of the Central Business District. Fares are regulated by the state government and all dispatch companies charge the same rate. Flagfall is $3.90 during weekdays, increasing to $5.70 on week nights and weekends. The kilometre rate is $1.59/km charged in $0.10 increments. Surcharges apply on designated holiday periods (New Year's Eve and Christmas Day) and on weekend nights between midnight and 5AM. Tipping taxi drivers in Perth is not customary, but adding a small gratuity ($1 or $2) on top of the fare is common for exceptional service.</p>
<p>Catching a taxi from an entertainment precinct late on a Friday or Saturday night sees clubbers waiting at taxi stands up to 2 hours for a ride home. Drivers are known to avoid picking up drunken patrons from outside of pubs, clubs or from the entrance to Perth central station. There have been sexual assaults on female passengers so it is advisable to travel in groups. There are specially designated 'secure ranks' operating at these times where patrons can queue in (relative) safety. Another option is the late night Transperth trains and buses run specially for revellers after their night out.</p>
<p>Services at Perth Airport are generally reliable, but at off peak times (1-8AM, be prepared for a potential wait at the taxi-stand as the line of waiting taxis crawl in one by one. The frequency at night drops off but there should still be a few cars waiting to meet incoming planes. A typical taxi ride from the Domestic Airport to the city is around $30 ($35 from the International). There is a $2 airport tax payable on top of the fare.</p>

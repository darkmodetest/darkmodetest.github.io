A handful of cross-city roads are signposted by alphanumeric code. The airport is signposted from many major routes with an aeroplane symbol.</p>
<p>Some motorways, tunnels and bridges charge tolls between $2 and $8 depending on the road and distance. There is no logic behind which ones charge and which ones don't - the reasons are all historical and political. Toll roads are indicated by the word TOLL or TOLL E-e on the signboard when joining the road. Tolls are charged on the:</p>
<p>If you want to plan a toll-free route, you can avoid the Cross City Tunnel, M2, M4, M5, M7, M8 or A8 Falcon Street on-ramp fairly easily. However, it is hard to avoid the harbour crossings if you are going to the CBD from Manly, the Northern Beaches or the zoo by car. If you're using a GPS check the toll-free routes, because outside of peak some toll roads offer little time saving.</p>
<p>All rental cars come with a way to pay tolls. They each charge their own service fees that can be a daily flat fee, or an administration fee and tolls. Some rental car companies register the licence plate, so you have no option other than to use their toll service.</p>
<p>If you are managing the tolls yourself you need to have a pass or a tag.</p>
<p>The Sydney Motorways website provides links to all tag and pass providers.</p>
<p>Not paying a toll within three days of driving on a toll road will incur a $15 administration fee in addition to the toll. If you are in a rental car, the rental car company will charge an additional fee for this to your credit card.</p>
<p>Parking in and around the city requires some consideration. Much of the available parking space in Sydney's centre and suburbs is time limited, and fees can apply.</p>
<p>Parking your car in the City Centre in parking stations is always possible but can be very expensive if you don't plan properly. Expect to pay up to $90 for three hours at some central parking lots if you just drive up. Prices generally reduce significantly on weekends however with some car parks charging $15-20 flat fee for full day parking. Reduced parking charges are also made on weekdays for early-bird parking, where you must enter and leave within prescribed times. For example you can park all day at the Opera House for $16 as long as you enter before 10AM and leave 3PM-7PM. There is no grace period, so you cannot get out even one minute before 3PM, and you will be charged the day parking rate of $42 if you are 10 seconds late. Most city parking lots offer reduced flat fees (around $15-$25) for evening and weekend parking. Booking parking online in advance can offer dramatic savings, with offers as low as $10 for all day parking sometimes available.</p>

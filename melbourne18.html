There are however options scattered throughout the suburbs.</p>
<p>The City Centre remains the main area for this category of accommodation.</p>
<p>Public phone booths can be found all around the city and the suburbs. Near stations and post-offices are the usual places to look. International calling cards are also available at convenience stores. Using Telstra payphones are free to make calls and they also have paid Wi-Fi hotspots.</p>
<p>Mobile phone coverage within the CBD and surrounds is usually good-to-excellent. 4G and 5G services are available throughout the city, however 3G services are unavaliable after late-2024. You will require some identification to purchase a prepaid (PAYG) SIM card, which are sold at most convenience stores, newsagents and supermarkets. This may be requested at time of purchase, and/or time of activation.</p>
<p>The networks are run by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone with other resellers available, and sometimes at a cheaper price. Shop around online for the most suitable deal if you want to save a few dollars. As is the case throughout Australia, you will need to be identified to access it – and if you're from overseas it's often easier to take your passport into a telco store than try and answer the identification questions online. Lycamobile and Lebara specialise in plans with cheaper international calls.</p>
<p>Melbourne's area code for landline telephones is 03 (internationally dial +613). To make an international direct dial call, the trunk line access code is generally 0011 or simply add a + in front of the number if your phone allows.</p>
<p>Melbourne offers a free public Wi-Fi which allows for up to 250 MB per device, per day and does not require personal information or feature pop-up advertising. It can be accessed in the Melbourne CBD including CBD train stations, Bourke St Mall, Queen Victoria Market and South Wharf Promenade at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre. Additionally, Internet cafes are dotted throughout the city, especially near the backpacker enclaves of St Kilda and Flinders Street. Speeds are usually excellent and rates range from $2.50–12 per hour, the cheapest usually found in combination market/internet cafes in the Asian parts of town.</p>
<p>The Australia-wide emergency number is 000, with the ambulance service, fire department and police being available through this number.</p>
<p>It is important to take care around tram lines. Trams are heavy and it can take over 100 metres for a tram to safely stop. Even if a tram has passed, look carefully both ways, as trams will often run nose-to-tail on busy corridors like Swanston Street. Many tram stops further from the CBD often require walking on to the road. There is often traffic around trams, so be careful crossing if running to catch a tram. </p>
<p>Driving in Melbourne can be nerve-wracking due to the presence of trams. You may have heard of the infamous "hook turn" that requires you to turn right from the left lane. These turns are predominantly in the CBD and become rarer as you head towards the suburbs. If driving, it is illegal to U-turn across tram tracks or pass a tram while the doors are open, and passengers are disembarking. Toll roads will be marked by blue signs with gold text indicating that you will be charged. Any electronic toll collection tag in Australia works on toll roads in Melbourne.</p>

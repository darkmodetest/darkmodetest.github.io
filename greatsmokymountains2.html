Afternoon showers and thunderstorms are common. Temperatures increase through the period with July and August afternoon highs in the 90s (30s Celsius) in the lower elevations. Evening lows are usually comfortable with readings in the 60s and 70s (15–25 °C). In the higher elevations, the weather is much more pleasant. On Mount Le Conte (6,593 feet/2,010 meters elevation), no temperature above 80 °F (27 °C) has ever been recorded.</p>
<p>September through mid-November: Clear skies and cooler weather signal the onset of the fall color season. Warm days alternate with cool nights. Daytime highs are usually in the 70s and 80s (20s Celsius) during September, falling to the 50s and 60s (10s Celsius) in early November. The first frosts often occur in late September. By November, the lows are usually near freezing. This is the driest period of the year with only occasional rain showers. In the higher elevations, snow is a possibility by November.</p>
<p>Mid-November through February: Winter in the Smokies is generally moderate, but extremes in weather do occur, especially with an increase in elevation. It is not unusual to have warm temperatures in the low elevations and snow in the higher areas. About half the days in the winter have high temperatures of 50 °F (10 °C) or more. Highs occasionally even reach the 70s (20s Celsius). Most nights have lows at or below freezing. But lows of −20 °F (−29 °C) are possible at high elevations. In the low elevations, snows of 1 inch (2.5 cm) or more occur 1-5 times a year. Snow falls more frequently in the higher mountains and up to two feet (60 cm) can fall during a storm. January and February are the months when one is most likely to find snow in the mountains.</p>
<p>The park has several visitor centers inside the park and some in the surrounding areas. These centers offer various ranger-led programs, facilities, services, and exhibits. Visitors can get information to help plan their visit to the park and get answers to their questions from park rangers. There are two main ones:</p>
<p>Access to the park is restricted to non-commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Planes will get you to Asheville (60 miles east) or Knoxville (45 miles west).</p>
<p>The closest train station is in Clemson, South Carolina, a two-hour drive from the park entrance near Bryson City.</p>
<p>Travelling by car is the best method to visit the park.  The most popular entrance into the park is from the north through Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  You can also enter from the south on the North Carolina side of the park, through Cherokee, Maggie Valley, or Bryson City.</p>
<p>There are no entrance fees charged for entering this park thanks to restrictions imposed when the park was established. However, parking tags are now required for all vehicles parked inside of the park for more than 15 minutes. These tags can be purchased at kiosks inside of the park. Daily and weekly tags can also be purchased at recreation.gov to be printed out. Additionally, annual passes can be purchased and shipped to you through Smokies Life.</p>

Privately operated, most trips cost less than ¥10 per short journey and only a little more for longer journeys.</p>
<p>Official taxis in Beijing are reliable and relatively inexpensive. If you don't speak Mandarin, it's advisable to have the Chinese characters for your destination ready in advance. Most people use ride-hailing apps like DiDi, accessible through the DiDi miniapp within Alipay, the preferred payment app for visitors, to call both official taxis and ridesharing services. You will likely only need to get into an official taxi directly from the airport or railway station taxi lines. While ridesharing taxis are available at these busy locations, it is often easier to wait in line for an official taxi due to the hectic nature of finding a ridesharing vehicle.</p>
<p>If the taxi driver "forgets" to switch the taxi meter on, remind him by politely asking them to run the meter and gesturing at the meter box (请打表 qǐng dǎbiǎo), though most can understand "meter please", and all can understand a simple point at the meter. At the end, it is a good idea to ask for a receipt (发票 fā piào) also while gesturing to the meter and making a writing motion. Having a receipt is handy in case you want to make a complaint later or for business reimbursement purposes, and since the receipt has the cab number, you stand a greater chance of getting your possessions back if you forget anything in the taxi.</p>
<p>If you want a tour around Beijing and its vicinities, you can ask your hotel to hire a cab for one day or several days. It usually costs ¥400-600 per day, depending on where you go. You can also ask just about any driver to perform this service as most are more than willing to do so. If you have Chinese-speaking assistance, then bargain down the cost. No matter the cost, the taxi is yours for the day and will wait for you at various destinations.</p>
<p>Communicating with the drivers can be a problem, as most do not speak English. Many will not even pick up foreign passengers on the street due to the perceived language barrier. The solution should that happen is to go into a nearby hotel and ask the desk staff to call a cab, or use a ride-hailing app.</p>
<p>You can ask that your hotel write your destination on a card to give to the driver. Make sure to take the hotel's card (and a map) that lists the hotel's address in Chinese. This can be a 'get out of jail free' card if you get lost and need to get back via taxi. A regular city map with streets and sights in Chinese will also help.</p>
<p>To avoid being taken advantage of, it is a good idea to know the rough direction, cost, and distance of your destination. If the cab goes in the wrong direction for a long distance, verify the location with the taxi driver. For scamming drivers, that is usually enough for them to go back on the right track (without ever acknowledging that they were trying to cheat you). Honest drivers will explain why they are going that way. In addition, sometimes a cab driver might tell you an extravagant price to get somewhere and tell you the meter is broken.</p>

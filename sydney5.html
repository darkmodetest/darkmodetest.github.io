<p>Circular Quay is a spectacular place to dock, right by the Harbour Bridge and across Sydney Cove from the Opera House, and you can walk off the ship into the city at The Rocks and then to the City Centre.</p>
<p>White Bay in the Inner West is not easy walking distance to anywhere. On cruise days there is a ferry operating to Darling Harbour, as well as taxis and transfer services organised by the cruise companies (usually to the city and airport). Cruisers embarking from White Bay have a spectacular sail away, first going under the Harbour Bridge and then passing by the Opera House.</p>
<p>At peak times some cruises can be anchored off Taronga Zoo (Athol Buoy, west of Bradleys Head). If this happens to you, you will be tendered to Circular Quay passenger terminal to complete immigration, etc.</p>
<p>The public transport system consists of suburban trains, metro, buses, ferries and light rail and can get you virtually anywhere in the city as well as much of the outer regions every day of the year. Public transportation in Sydney can be complicated, even when travelling solely in the CBD and inner suburbs. For short distances in the CBD it can be faster to walk than taking public transport.</p>
<p>Smartphone applications such as Google Maps, TripView, Moovit and Arrivo Sydney use live transit information for all modes of transport are very useful for public transport trips within the Sydney region. Tripview is best for a known route that you want the latest times. Moovit or Google Maps are best if don't know the route, and need timing and stop-by-stop information. These apps are available on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>At all of Sydney's public transport stations/stops, you will see a lollipop sign with a single capitalised letter and a coloured background that indicates the type of transport service available (i.e. train, bus, light rail or ferry). The sign "T" in orange means train, "M" in teal means metro, "B" in blue means bus", F" in green means ferry and "L" in red means light rail (Tram). You may find that many bus stops still don't have the blue "B" signage as they are still being progressively upgraded. Some bus stops also might say "T-way", referring to a name for bus rapid transit (BRT) lines. A purple "C" means Coach however, these are very rarely used and on the rare occasion on if they are used, it is usually a train replacement coach.</p>
<p>Many Sydney Trains stations are easy access, with lifts to all platforms and ramps operated by station staff to allow wheelchair access to trains. All Sydney Metro stations are fully accessible with lifts and level access between platforms and trains. Some buses have disabled access. All light rail stops are wheelchair accessible. Access to the light rail is via an on-board ramp. Wheelchair friendly buses, stations, and routes are indicated on the timetable, and in the real time apps.</p>

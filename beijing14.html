In the Haidian District, highlights include the majestic Summer Palace (颐和园), the ruins of the Old Summer Palace (圆明园), the scenic Fragrant Hills (香山), and the lush Beijing Botanical Garden (北京植物园). These sites are close to one another, making them convenient to visit in a single trip.</p>
<p>Further afield, Beijing has two lesser-visited UNESCO World Heritage sites that may not be particularly captivating. The Ming Tombs in Changping District feature three open tombs, but excavations have ceased since 1989 due to previous botched attempts. In Fangshan District, the Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian is notable for its archaeological discoveries, including early Homo erectus specimens; however, much of the original material was lost during the Japanese occupation in 1941, leaving only replicas on display. For a more interesting experience, consider visiting the Eastern Qing Tombs, which offer superior landscaping, although they are more challenging to access, as they are located in Zunhua in the neighboring province of Hebei.</p>
<p>For those spending an extended time in Beijing, consider popular day trips favored by locals. In rural Yanqing District, you can explore the often-overlooked Guyaju Caves, a fascinating complex of rock-carved dwellings believed to date back to the Tang Dynasty. Nearby, Longqing Gorge, known as the "Little Three Gorges" for its resemblance to the famous Three Gorges near Yichang, offers scenic views. In Fangshan District, you'll discover stunning natural caves formed by the region's karst landscape, some of which feature short boat trips through shallow waters inside the caves.</p>
<p>The museums in Beijing are generally not yet up to the standard seen in cities such as Paris, Rome, New York or even Taipei. However the city contains one of the largest and most well known museums in Asia, the Palace Museum also known as the Forbidden City. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. China's government is determined to change the backward perception of its museums and has invested heavily in their development. It has also made most of them (not the Forbidden City) free to visit. However, for some museums, tickets must be reserved three days in advance.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known museums in Beijing is the National Museum (国家博物馆) in Dongcheng District, which was renovated in 2011.  The Military Museum (军事博物馆) in Haidian District has long been a favorite with domestic and foreign tourists.  The Capital Museum (首都博物馆) in Xicheng District is a new high-profile museum with historical and art exhibitions. The China Aviation Museum (中国民航博物馆) located in the Beijing/Northern Suburbs is surprisingly good and hosts 200+ rare and unique Chinese (mostly Russian) aircraft. Finally, a number of restored former residences of famous Beijingers, especially in Xicheng District, give a good insight into daily life in former times.</p>
<p>The contemporary art scene in Beijing is thriving, with numerous artists showcasing and selling their work in galleries throughout the city. The most established and easily accessible area is the 798 Art District in Chaoyang District anchored by the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art. This district has a commerical atmosphere of mainstream galleries and luxury billboards dotting the area.  Other notable art districts include the Caochangdi Art District in Chaoyang District and the Songzhuang Art Community in Tongzhou District. Yanjiao, outside of Beijing, is home to studios of young artists who had sought lower rents in Hebei province.</p>

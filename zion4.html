Both routes are operated by SkyWest. Flying into Cedar City (30 miles / 50 km north of Zion National Park) from Salt Lake City on SkyWest is an additional option.</p>
<p>The nearest major airport is Harry Reid International Airport (LAS IATA) in Las Vegas, about a three-hour drive to the park on Interstate 15.</p>
<p>The second closest major airport is in Salt Lake City (SLC IATA), about a five-hour drive on I-15.</p>
<p>There is no public transportation into the park.  Tour buses can be arranged through travel agencies, and Greyhound buses visit the cities of Salt Lake City, Cedar City, St. George, plus Las Vegas in Nevada. For Utah Greyhound information call +1 435 586-9465.</p>
<p>Entrances fees are valid for seven days, allowing unlimited re-entry for the week.  Private vehicles which only visit Kolob Canyons still need to pay the entrance fee (good for the whole park).  Fees as of 2020 are:</p>
<p>There are several passes for groups traveling together in a private vehicle or individuals on foot/bike that provide free entry to Zion National Park and all national parks, as well as some national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and national forests:</p>
<p>The National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks on five days every year:</p>
<p>The length of the road through the park (Utah Hwy 9) end to end including the tunnel is 11.5 miles (18.5 km). The tunnel itself is just over a mile (close to 2 km). Going west to east, you gain 1,850 feet (564 m).</p>
<p>The majority of the park is accessible by car, although Zion Canyon is accessible only by the free shuttle from April through the end of October.  Large vehicles, (7'10" in width or 11'4" in height), (RV's, buses, trailers, 5th wheels, and some camper shells) that wish to travel the length of the park, require an escort to be stationed at both ends of the Zion-Mt. Carmel Tunnel. Large vehicles have trouble staying in their lane while traveling through the tunnel. Escort costs are $15 per vehicle, valid for two trips through the tunnel during a seven-day period. Very large vehicles, including those taller than 13'1", may be prohibited from entering the tunnel.</p>
<p>During the winter Zion roads are plowed and sanded, except the Kolob Terrace road, which is closed. Be prepared for winter driving conditions, including potentially icy roads, from November through March.</p>
<p>From mid-March through the end of October, Zion uses a shuttle system to eliminate congestion in the canyon. The Zion Canyon Scenic Drive is closed to all private vehicles during this time (except those with a red pass that are staying at the Zion Lodge). Shuttles are fully accessible, with extra room for bikes, backpacks, and climbing gear.</p>
<p>Zion operates two different shuttle routes. One goes through the town of Springdale (see the Get around section on Springdale), and terminates at the Park entrance, within walking distance of the visitor center.</p>

Many restaurants of all kinds can be found in the Haarlemmerbuurt. Also worth trying is the Van Woustraat in De Pijp, or continue to the Rijnstraat in the Rivierenbuurt. Exquisite but expensive restaurants can be found in the Utrechtsestraat. While there are exceptions, in general avoid restaurants along Damrak and be cautious around Leidseplein—they are well known tourist traps.</p>
<p>Amsterdam's de facto Chinatown is at Zeedijk, near the bustling Nieuwmarkt square, where you can find a delightful array of Asian eateries, not limited to Chinese, Thai and Japanese restaurants. It contains many tokos, which are small East Asian grocery stores containing Eastern culinary treasures and aromatic spices. Chinatown also contains Indonesian and Indian restaurants, though the latter can get expensive, depending on your budget.</p>
<p>Budget-friendly feasts can be found along the charming lanes of Damstraat and Muntplein, where many Middle Eastern establishments can be found.</p>
<p>Amsterdam may not be your first thought when it comes to Surinamese cuisine, but nobody said you couldn't savour this relatively-unknown culinary delight. The best places to find Surinamese cuisine are Zuid and Zuidoost, especially along the eminent Albert Cuypstraat. Local favourites include roti met bonen, moksi meti, petjil, and the sweet finale of bojo as a dessert.</p>
<p>A popular drink that you can't not try is dawet – it's a unique beverage crafted from milk, coconut and rose syrup, featuring delightful sago balls (kids also ostensibly like it). Although popularised in Suriname, its origins trace back to Indonesia – as such, you can find it in several Indonesian restaurants.</p>
<p>Cheese can be bought at the Albert Cuyp Market, or at specialist cheese shops found around the city centre. Dutch cheese is traditionally firm, made in large wax-covered wheels, and falls into two main categories—young and old. There is a rich variety within these categories. Among the more unusual young cheeses is cumin cheese (komijnenkaas), which is particular to the Netherlands. Sheep cheese (schapenkaas) and goat cheese (geitenkaas) are also common. Old cheese can be made of any sort of milk, and is often reminiscent of Italian Parmesan in consistency and sharpness of flavour.</p>
<p>Check out bitterballen, fried breaded ragout balls, and kroketten (the same, but shaped like a cylinder), but take care not to burn your mouth. Also don't forget to try a traditional herring or a broodje haring (herring sandwich), available from fish stalls around the city. Herring in Amsterdam is usually served with onions and pickles. A good try is the fish stand on the Koningsplein near the Bloemenmarkt. Syrup waffles (stroopwafels) are made fresh at the Albert Cuyp. If you're visiting in late November or December, you can enjoy oliebollen, which are round blobs of sweet fried dough embedded with raisins (sultanas) and dusted with powdered sugar.</p>
<p>Amsterdam's famously wild nightlife caters to all tastes and budgets. The archetypical Amsterdam watering hole is the bruine café ("brown bar"), a neighbourhood bar of sorts with gorgeous dark wood panelling—hence the name—and booths. Grand cafés are more grand and spacious, and also serve small food portions. These usually have at least one long table with newspapers and magazines. Lounge and designer bars pop up across the city catering to the city's younger and more trend susceptible crowd. If you're a beer lover consider visiting a beer shop or tasting room in the Binnenstad or the brewery in Plantage. There are some excellent beers you can get from this part of the world such as wheat beer (witbeer).</p>

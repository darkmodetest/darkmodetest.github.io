You find many mid-range accommodation providers within the CBD (mostly in the southern Haymarket end), and within a short distance of the city by public transport, including in North Sydney, the Inner West and the North Shore. Sometimes cheaper motel style accommodation can be obtained on the roads leading into Sydney, particularly in South Western Sydney</p>
<p>


Luxurious hotels can be found all over Sydney. The most expensive hotels are generally located in the CBD and the Rocks district, near the business hub of Sydney, close to many restaurants, often featuring spectacular harbour views. Some other high quality hotels are in Darling Harbour. You may check the list below for specific locations.</p>
<p>Please visit one of the various Sydney districts described in the Districts section above to see the accommodation listings.</p>
<p>


Serviced, short-term apartments are widely available throughout Sydney and are available for stays as short as one night. Amenities typically include kitchen, washer and dryer, and separate bedrooms. A range of properties exist from budget to five-star.</p>

<p>The Australia-wide emergency number is 000, with the ambulance service, fire department and police being available through this number.</p>
<p>Be on the lookout for the usual big city petty crime problems. Lock your car, and keep valuables safe or hidden. People begging may ask for money or cigarettes, but they are generally harmless. They will often make up the usual stories about needing a train fare etc. Simply say "Sorry mate" and they will usually leave you alone.</p>
<p>Sydney has some of the violent crime issues that plague major cities. However, in general, no special precautions are required visiting the typical tourist areas during the day.</p>
<p>Most assaults in Sydney take place in or near pubs and nightclubs at night, and involve alcohol. Most involve young males as perpetrators and victims. Most robberies occur in nearby quiet laneways, or parks close to pubs and nightclubs at night. The most common perpetrators or robberies are drug addicts. For this reason, take care around Kings Cross, The Rocks, Oxford St, and in George St between Town Hall and Central Station, especially late at night on Fridays and Saturday nights. Avoid Redfern station late at night. Even changing trains late at night is best done at Central rather than Redfern. Women should take extra care at bars and keep an alert companion at hand, especially in the central hostel area, and take precautions against spiked drinks.</p>
<p>Some areas of south-western and western Sydney have a reputation, generally gained by news reports of motorcycle and other gang related violence. However, if you want to venture out into these areas during the day, there is no exceptional risk. If you're planning to head way off the tourist trail to some suburban pub or nightclub for a night out, seek some local advice. It may be a nice pub, but it pays to be informed. Areas around railway stations tend to be hang-outs for youth gangs in Western Sydney, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. Stay in company, and don't engage.</p>

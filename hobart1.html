<p>Hobart is the capital city of Tasmania and is Australia's second oldest city, after Sydney. Hobart sits along the Derwent River and began humbly as a penal colony. Hobart is now a small and intimate city with a population of around 247,000 (as of 2020) in the Greater Hobart area. The city is renowned for its many historic buildings, including the famous Salamanca Place, and is the gateway to Southern Tasmania.  Hobart played a major role during the heroic age of Antarctic exploration and is one of the five gateway cities to Antarctica.</p>
<p>Founded in 1804 by Colonel David Collins, Hobart is the second oldest city in Australia. It grew out of the penal settlement on the island at Risdon Cove, 8 km upriver, which was founded in 1803 and abandoned five months later for the present site of Hobart.</p>
<p>In the first half of the 1800s, the whaling boom generated a surge in maritime support industries and infrastructure. Whaling ceased in the late 1800s, but Hobart never lost its boat-building, ship-chandlery and provedoring legacy. This made Hobart a logical staging post in the heroic age of Antarctic exploration. France’s Dumont d’Urville, Australia’s Douglas Mawson, England’s James Clark Ross, and Norway’s Carsten Borchgrevink and Roald Amundsen all paused in the Derwent on their way to Antarctica.</p>
<p>In December 1911, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition led by Mawson was given a rousing send-off from Hobart’s Sullivans Cove.  A few months later, Amundsen brought Fram into Hobart in order to send a telegram to the King of Norway with the news that his party had reached the South Pole. After sending the telegram, Amundsen publicly announced his feat from the Hobart General Post Office sandstone steps. A few months later, Mawson’s Antarctic party sent the first wireless messages from Antarctica to the outside world – to a receiving station on Hobart’s Queens Domain.</p>

<p>Hobart has a mild temperate oceanic climate owing to its fairly southerly latitude (42.88°S) and proximity to the Southern Ocean. As such, daily temperatures rarely reach above the low 20s, except during heat waves in summer. Nightly lows typically range around 10-12°C during summer and 4-5°C in winter, so cold weather gear is recommended all year round. So, even in summer, you should always bring a jumper just in case, and in the coldest months (May, June, July, August and September), pack layers. It is not unheard of for temperatures to drop below zero during winter, with Hobart's lowest temperature on record being a chilly -2.8°C, with sleet sometimes occurring and in the outer suburbs it even snows. Interestingly, Hobart has the second fewest daily hours of sunlight out of all Australian cities, at 5.9 hours on average for the year. The sun is only up between 7:30AM and 4:45PM in the winter months. However, during the summer it has the most hours of daylight of any Australian city, with 15.2 hours on the summer solstice, with daylight from 5:30AM to 8:45PM.</p>

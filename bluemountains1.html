<p>The Blue Mountains National Park is a large, world Heritage-listed national park occupying much of the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales. The park has many cliffs, plateaus, valleys, waterfalls and something a trip to Sydney is never complete without. Blue Mountains National Park is also New South Wales' most visited national park receiving over 8 million visitors in 2018. </p>
<p>The park is home to many kangaroos and other wildlife. When walking in the bush, especially in the summer, be aware of snakes.</p>
<p>In the open forests, the Australian echidna is relatively common. Presumably some koalas, which were still common in this area around 1900s, are still in the park. Species that are nocturnal and therefore difficult to observe include brushtail possum and various flying squirrel possums unless you choose to camp. </p>
<p>The denser forests are also inhabited by bandicoots, broad-legged bag mice, swamp wallabies, and giant gliders. The largest marsupial predator is the giant quoll, which also inhabits dense forests. Especially in the more open areas, where grasses and woody coexist, there are nudibranch wombats , red-necked wallabies , mountain kangaroos and eastern grey kangaroos. The region's largest predator is the dingo, which is a feral dog. There are also foxes, cats, horses and cattle in the park, which are not originally native and were introduced by the British, and have a negative impact on the local wildlife.</p>

<p>Most roads are gravel roads, but are gazetted formed roads. Check your rental agreement if you are renting a car.</p>
<p>There's a few ways to get into the key areas of the park...</p>
<p>Glenbrook — Turn off left into Rose St to enter into Glenbrook. At the T intersection of Burfitt Parade, turn left and follow that street down into Bruce Rd. Follow that road down past the bridge over the railway. Park at the National Parks & Wildlife Office to get your pass.</p>
<p>Katoomba — The easiest path to get to Echo Point: Once you enter into Katoomba from Parke St, turn left on the first roundabout, and then straight along the second. Turn right onto Lurline St, and follow that street until the end. You should get to the corner of Echo Point Rd and Cliff Dr.</p>
<p>Blackheath — When you enter Blackheath, turn right onto Grovetts Leap Rd. The entry is the Blue Mountains Heritage Centre.</p>
<p>Lower Grose Valley (Vale of Avoca Lookout) — After driving into Kurrajong, turn left onto Old Bells of Line/Grose Vale Road. Follow it until you turn right on Cabbage Tree Rd,  and drive until you reach the end carpark. The road is mostly sealed until you enter the park, where it comes unsealed.</p>
<p>Mount Wilson — Turn right into Mount Wilson Rd.</p>
<p>Some buses run to Katoomba close to Echo Point. See the Katoomba article for information. Other buses also run to Blackheath, although this is not that common.</p>
<p>A cost of $8 per vehicle applies at the Glenbrook entrance. Further up the mountains visitors there are no fees but you may have to pay for parking within the park.</p>

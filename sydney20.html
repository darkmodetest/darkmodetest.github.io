However, make up aside, the transformation from men into women is incredible and these ladies sure know how to entertain. Drag shows are popular with hen nights and birthday parties, but really they’re great fun for anyone who wants a night of pure unadulterated entertainment. Some drag acts are part of cabaret clubs, so there's a wide variety of acts throughout the evening. Other clubs are solely dedicated to drag performances and it’s a whirlwind of costume changes, make-up and incredible dance moves.</p>
<p>Sydney is home to a number of major and minor festivals and calendar events each year. Listed chronologically these are:</p>
<p>You can take language classes, join a cafe book group, learn to draw, sign up for historical or foodie walks, or take computer or business classes at City of Sydney Library, where you can sign up to borrow books or just read magazines in their café as well.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly as Australia's second-largest city, Sydney is home to many universities. Two of these universities, the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are part of the prestigious "Group of Eight". There are opportunities for international students to enroll in these universities, either in their degree programs or through exchange agreements with foreign universities. These provide foreigners with an excellent opportunity of live in Sydney for an extended period.</p>
<p>See the Sydney District Pages for things to buy in the CBD, and other Sydney districts.</p>
<p>Most stores will accept VISA/Mastercard credit cards, and only a few take only cash. American Express is generally accepted only at larger stores.</p>
<p>As with the rest of Australia, currency exchange offices operate in a free market, and the small convenient exchange booth you pass on George Street, by the Opera House or at the airport can charge 15% or more over the best rate you can obtain elsewhere. As always, check rates and commission carefully. Know today's rate and be prepared to walk away if the amount of money they calculate isn't what you would expect. Banks typically offer much better rates, but are only open business hours on weekdays.</p>
<p>You may find it better to pay by credit card and use ATM withdrawals and have the certainty of getting the rate and fees provided by your bank.</p>
<p>Main department stores and specialty stores open around 8 or 9AM and close around 6 or 7PM, staying open until 9PM on Thursday. On Sunday expect them to open around 10AM in the suburbs, and around 11AM in the CBD, and to close at 5PM. There are a few locations where you will find shops opening a little later, such as Darling Harbour which is open until 9PM every weeknight.</p>
<p>Large supermarkets will be open from 6AM until midnight.</p>
<p>Many convenience stores, fast-food restaurants and petrol stations within the Sydney metro area are open 24 hours a day.</p>

However, Berlin is also known for its foxes, which are visible not only in parks but also at times on quiet streets of relatively built-up, centrally located neighborhoods at night. There is also a great variety of bird life, especially in the huge Tiergarten, where you can hear Eurasian blackbirds, nightingales, European robins, goldfinches, blackcaps and quite a few other songbirds in the spring and summer.</p>
<p>From 1871 to 1940, Berlin was a centre for major German industrial companies and the administrative headquarters of many companies in all fields. However, soon after the Second World War ended, many of these companies moved south or west, went bankrupt, or were nationalised in the GDR. </p>
<p>Berlin consequently became a centre of research, rather than of production. West Berlin had a special subsidy for "Berlin-made" industrial products during partition, but those were usually products which had the bare minimum of production occur in Berlin to benefit from the subsidy and almost all of those schemes ceased the moment the subsidy was ended after reunification.</p>
<p>While some company headquarters have moved to Berlin since reunification in 1990, the dominance of the capital is much less pronounced in the German economy than in that of most other European countries. Despite the economic boost resulting from the country's capital moving back to the city, Berlin's unemployment rate soared over 10% from 2000 to 2010. Berlin today is known in Germany for being a centre of creative branches such as design and arts of all kinds; you will see a lot of people working with Notebooks in some coffee shops. </p>
<p>Since reunification some companies have established head offices in Berlin but in many cases those exist primarily to have a "representative" address on the letterhead and a lot of administration, let alone development or production is still done outside Berlin. In what many Berliners hope to be a sign of a trend change, Berlin founded industrial conglomerate Siemens is once again moving into its 1920s "Siemensstadt" in the 2020s to have a capital location for research, administration and production.</p>
<p>As Berlin grew from several different towns and villages, there is not one centre per se but rather several centres which can make orientation a bit difficult.</p>
<p>The apocryphal adage about Washington DC's street layout being designed to confuse invading armies could apply to Berlin as well, if it were designed by anybody to do anything at all. Berlin's streets are confusing and follow no logic to speak of, owing to the development of the city and to decades of partition. Cardinal directions are of little use: almost nothing is aligned straightforwardly east–west, nor north–south, not even the former border. Street signs therefore usually bear the names of boroughs and sometimes local landmarks.</p>
<p>There may be different streets of the same name scattered across the city. For example, there are at least three streets named "Potsdamer Straße": one in Lichtenrade, one in Zehlendorf and another one in Giesendorf. This is not an uncommon thing in Berlin in part due to it having been a bunch of separate cities and villages. Some of the more common names have since been changed, but by far not all of them. It is a good idea to always keep in mind which district you are travelling to. German postal codes are pretty fine-grained and usually the same street-name should not appear twice in the same code, so try and use the full address with postal code and/or district. Taxi drivers somehow have to (and usually do) know most of those strange and repeating street names. As Istanbul-born comedian Serdar Somuncu quipped with regard to the many Turkish-descendant taxi drivers, "A German wouldn't go to Istanbul to become a taxi driver, yet countless Turkish taxi drivers get people to one of the three dozen Goethe Straßen in Berlin without fail every day".</p>

Or for locals to climb up a hill after work before heading home. One of the most popular with visitors is the walk to the lookout atop Mount Ainslie from North Canberra. Other popular bushwalking destinations within the urban pars of Canberra include Cooleman Ridge, Mount Taylor, Oakey Hill, The Pinnacle, Red Hill etc. and ACT Walking for Pleasure have maps, and schedules each week.</p>
<p>Lake Burley Griffin is a core part of Canberra's design, separating the two subdistricts of North and South Canberra; only generalised information is covered here. Otherwise, see the district articles.</p>
<p>Whether it's on or off the water. You can:</p>
<p>As the national capital, Canberra is also home to a number of research-oriented facilities. The National Archives of Australia, Australian War Memorial and National Library of Australia are important research centres, including for people researching their family history. Readers cards are available for free to Australian residents, though the institutions charge for photocopying. The National Museum of Australia, ANU and several government departments also maintain specialised archives and facilities which are available to researchers. The ACT Heritage Library serves as Canberra's state library and administers a collection of items related to the history of the territory.</p>
<p>Canberra is home to several markets, and they're scattered across the territory (except the country bits). Most of them operate during Sundays, and each and every market is different. Some of them may appear to be just "another plain old Sunday market" while others such as the Trash and Treasure Market, which is exactly the name of the market suggests.</p>
<p>Being the capital, there are several shopping malls in Canberra. They don't exactly have the same availability as you would find in places like Sydney or Melbourne, but you have to remember that Canberra is 10 times smaller than either of those two cities. The important malls are as follows: </p>
<p>Many of the most interesting shopping experiences are at the national institutions, almost all of which have specialist shops inside. The National Gallery has a superb range of art books, both overseas and indigenous. Likewise the National Library, the Questacon Science Museum, the War Memorial, the National Museum at Acton, the Film and Sound Archive, and so on - if you're looking for unique Australian items, these are the places to go.</p>
<p>Canberra's bookstores showcase many different things from Asian history, to military history, to non-fiction, the city is well-covered with bookstores. While Canberra is a bookish city, it lacks a stand-out bookshop but each is worth going to in its own right.</p>
<p>Canberra has many fine eateries, but beware – many will be closed on Sundays. There are large clusters of restaurants in Civic, Braddon, Dickson, Kingston and Manuka. An unusual feature of the Canberra dining scene is that some of the city's best restaurants are hidden away in small suburban shopping centres – locals often nominate these as their favourites.</p>

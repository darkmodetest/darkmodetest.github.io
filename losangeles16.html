The Major League Baseball Los Angeles Dodgers are one of the most famous teams in baseball and a game at Dodger Stadium in Elysian Park, in the hills north of downtown, is an absolute treat for baseball fans. However, LA's most successful sports franchise has been and remains the Los Angeles Lakers of the NBA, undoubtedly one of the greatest basketball teams in history. They play at Crypto.com Arena in Downtown, which they shared with another NBA team, the much less successful Los Angeles Clippers, before the Clippers moved to the new Intuit Dome in Inglewood in 2024. Also playing at Crypto.com Arena are the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League and the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA. The city has two Major League Soccer teams—the LA Galaxy, which plays at Dignity Health Sports Park in Carson, and Los Angeles FC, which started play in 2018 at BMO Stadium in Exposition Park. Angel City FC started play in the National Women's Soccer League in 2022, playing in LAFC's stadium.</p>
<p>The National Football League now has two teams in the L.A. area, both having returned to the area after having spent decades elsewhere. The Los Angeles Rams, which called L.A. home from 1946 to 1994 before moving to St. Louis, returned to L.A. in 2016. The Los Angeles Chargers, which started their life in the old American Football League in 1960,  moved to San Diego the next year and didn't return until 2017. Both teams share SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. For the second-largest city in the country, Los Angeles long showed an inexplicable inability to hold down a NFL franchise; during the Rams' stint in St. Louis, Los Angeles football fans made do with the local college teams: the USC Trojans football team plays in the Coliseum, while the UCLA Bruins play in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, which also hosts the annual famous college bowl game the stadium is named after.</p>
<p>In addition, Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels and the National Hockey League's Anaheim Ducks play in nearby Anaheim in Orange County.</p>
<p>Major college sports in L.A. aren't limited to USC and UCLA, although those schools have by far the highest profiles since they're the only two NCAA Division I schools in the area that play football. The immediate L.A. area boasts seven other Division I programs. The city of Los Angeles boasts the Cal State Northridge Matadors (or CSUN Matadors) in the San Fernando Valley district of Northridge and the Loyola Marymount Lions in Westchester, while Los Angeles County also boasts the Pepperdine Waves just outside the Malibu city limits and the Long Beach State teams, known as The Beach. Orange County is home to the Cal State Fullerton Titans and UC Irvine Anteaters, while the Inland Empire city of Riverside is home to the UC Riverside Highlanders and the California Baptist Lancers.</p>
<p>The USA Sevens, the country's annual event in the SVNS, the current incarnation of World Rugby's series for men's and women's national teams in rugby sevens, returned to Dignity Health Sports Park in the 2023–24 season. Rugby sevens is a variant of rugby union played on a full-sized field, but with seven players per side instead of 15, and halves of 7 minutes instead of 40. The short duration of each game allows a complete tournament to be held over a single weekend. Both the men's and women's tournaments feature 12 teams, and the event strongly encourages a festival atmosphere.</p>

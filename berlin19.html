It is usually a bad idea to rent a car to get around Berlin. Driving around Berlin can be expensive and time consuming compared to a combination of walking and public transport, but compared to other European cities with dense old towns and narrow streets, many drivers don't find the streets of Berlin to be too stressful. If you're committed to driving within the city, remember that only low-emission vehicles displaying the green certification sticker are permitted inside the low emission zone (Umweltzone), which roughly matches the area inside the Ringbahn. Rental cars from agencies in Germany should already have the sticker.</p>
<p>On-street parking varies by neighbourhood. Most areas within the Ringbahn charge for street parking during daytime or business hours, Monday though Saturday. Some areas charge all week long; pay attention to signage or check the online map (available in German only). Hourly rates range from €2-4 (2023), and you can pay at an electronic meter (Parkscheinautomat) or on an app. Outside the managed areas, you can park for free (where space is available). Most areas of the city are within a reasonable walk or short transit ride of some free parking.</p>
<p>Parking garages (Parkhaus or underground Tiefgarage) are common in busy areas. Hourly rates are comparable to surrounding street rates, but 24-hour rates can be significantly cheaper. Deutsche Bahn provides a map with details of parking facilities near train stations and throughout the city. Note that not all hotels provide parking, but they should be able to direct guests to a Parkplatz nearby. Entrances to parking structures can be tough to find; look for the standard sign (a white "P" on a blue square). Alternatively it's possible to park your car at one of the free Park and Ride (P+R) parking lots next to S-Bahn stations outside the Ringbahn.</p>
<p>Despite not being a maritime city like Hamburg or Venice, Berlin does have usable waterways and the BVG run a couple of ferries, which can be accessed with regular BVG tickets. Most of the ferries are of local interest only, but the Ferry line F10 covers 4.4 km (2.7 mi) across the Wannsee and connects to the S-Bahn at one end. More of a tourist attraction than actual practical transportation is Ferry F24, which is the only ferry operated by a rowing boat in Berlin and the only rowing boat ferry that is part of any public transit ticketing system in Germany. In an effort to become a "greener" city some of the ferries run on electricity provided by solar panels on their roofs or land based charging stations.</p>
<p>In addition to those public transit ferries there are tour boats doing sight seeing trips mostly along the river Spree and mostly as circular tours. They are much more expensive than BVG tickets.</p>
<p>In the course of the 2017 international gardening exhibition in Berlin/East, Berlin received its first gondola lift[dead link], which stayed in operation after the exhibition closed. It links to Kienberg (Gärten der Welt) U-Bahn station along  U5  at one end and has all of three stations along a line length of 1,580 m (5,180 ft) which is comparable to U55. It is not part of BVG ticketing and at €6.50 per return trip, tickets are comparatively expensive.</p>

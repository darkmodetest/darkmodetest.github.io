<p>A taxi direct to Seoul will cost around ₩50,000/70,000 regular/deluxe.</p>
<p>Gimpo Airport is easily reached on the A'REX link from Seoul Station or Incheon Airport, as well as subway lines 5 and 9. All lines intersect Line 2 which runs in a large circle through Seoul. Line 9 (Gold Line), the first privately run subway line in Seoul, has express trains as well. Travelers coming into Seoul should first have detailed directions to their destination from the nearest station then consult the subway map before deciding on which line and route to take. All three lines cost ₩1,000-2,100 (depending on distance), while a taxi to central Seoul will run around ₩30,000. Discounts for subway fare are available with T-Money cards.</p>
<p>Seoul is the northern terminus for most KTX high-speed train services. There are three main stations within city limits:</p>
<p>Every weekend approximately 2 million Seoulites leave the city, which goes a long way to explaining why the city has four major bus terminals. Destinations are not strictly divided by terminals (especially intercity buses), so check the exact terminal and schedule on the website (Express, Intercity)</p>
<p>There are ferry services to various points in China from the neighboring port city of Incheon. No services run from Japan to Seoul; many Koreans take the coach, KTX or SRT trains to Busan, where several ferry and hydrofoil options are available.</p>
<p>No matter where in Korea you start your journey, there will be tolled expressways (Gosok Doro) and national highways (Gook Do) that lead to Seoul; the most important one is the Gyeongbu Expressway, linking Seoul with Busan. To avoid the daily traffic jam on the Gyeongbu Highway near Seoul, take Jungbu/2nd Jungbu, Seohaean, or Yongin-Seoul Expressway. On Korean highways, the first lane is used as a passing lane. for overtaking. No matter how fast you're going, it's not okay to keep driving in the lane.</p>
<p>Traffic jams are all too common in Seoul, so be careful on the streets and head underground when possible. Street and subway signage is usually written in English as well as Korean.</p>
<p>Until 2011, Seoul (and South Korea as a whole) used an address system that was similar to that of Japan, where the streets did not have names and houses were numbered according to the position in the lot. This very confusing address system made it harder for tourists to navigate Seoul, and the government has introduced a Road Name Address System, which uses street names and the method of "odd house numbers on one side, even house numbers on the other side". The confusing old address system was discontinued in 2013, and nowadays, Seoul is easy to get around without extra help.</p>
<p>In Seoul, you can visit most places by using the vast subway network. There are nine numbered lines plus a smattering of named suburban lines, all distinguished by different colors. All signs in the subway system are in Korean (both hangeul and if applicable, hanja) and English, as well as Japanese and Mandarin in some stations. The signs leading to the platform for a particular direction of travel on a given subway line typically list the names of a number of stations in that direction. Stations each have a 3 digit number, but locals rarely make use of these numbers, and they're not on most subway maps, so don't rely on them. An English subway map can be found here.</p>

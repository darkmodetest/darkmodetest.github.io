Many international airlines and low-cost carriers fly into Mumbai.</p>
<p>Thane Creek is bustling with ferries to central Mumbai from various cities on the southern and eastern side of the creek, such as Alibag. Ferries from Ferry Wharf also allow cheap access to islands and beaches in the vicinity of the city and Elephanta.</p>
<p>There are no scheduled international ferries to Mumbai, however cruise ships dock regularly.</p>
<p>The first commercial railway service began on 16th April 1853 at 3:35PM on its first run between Victoria Terminus (present-day CSMT) and Thane.</p>
<p>Hundreds of trains arrive daily from all over India, almost all major cities have a direct connection with Mumbai. Trains terminate at various different stations throughout the vast city, so make sure to note which station is relevant for your journey.</p>
<p>Main reservation offices are Churchgate, Mumbai Central and Bandra for the Western line and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and Dadar on the Central line. There are unique ticket windows and quotas for foreign tourists. Bookings and tariffs on train tickets from anywhere in India from Mumbai can be found at the website of Indian Railways. Notice that while all trains are operated by Indian Railways, the Western and Central Lines function independently and reservations can only be made at certain stations.</p>
<p>The private luxury service Maharajas' Express has travel packages between Mumbai and Delhi. A high-speed railway from Ahmedabad is under construction and is planned to open in 2027.</p>
<p>National highway numbers 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 17, and the Mumbai-Pune expressway radiate from the city providing links to all parts of the country. The road conditions are generally better than in the rest of India. Distances from various cities to Mumbai are:</p>
<p>Mumbai is well served by buses from destinations inside India.</p>
<p>Most of Mumbai's inhabitants rely on public transport to and from their workplaces due to the lack of parking spaces, traffic bottlenecks and generally poor road conditions, especially in the monsoon. However, do ride in a taxi and auto at least once in the city. Feel real adventure in a vehicle that feels like it might fall apart at a speed over 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) with a driver who thinks he's Schumacher.</p>
<p>For travelling using public transport, you can download the m-Indicator app for Android and iPhone. It contains useful information about bus and train routes, which can help you plan your commute.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there used to be a fleet of Premier Padmini taxis plying around in Mumbai. They were fondly called "Kaali-Peeli" for their distinctive black and yellow colour. Sadly, the iconic taxis of the city were phased out by October 2023. However, you may still find these vehicles in the form of private cars and not as taxis.</p>
<p>There are several types of taxis plying in Mumbai. You can hail a cab off the streets. Virtually all taxis have electronic meters which are somewhat tamper-proof. A taxi driver cannot refuse a fare as per law. If a driver does refuse, a threat to complain to the nearest cop usually does the trick. The minimum fare for 1 mi (1.6 km) or less is ₹28 (in 2022).</p>

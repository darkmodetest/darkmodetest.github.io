Despite its name, it is not a Metro system in the usual sense of the word, but a suburban rail system.</p>
<p>Travelling north:</p>
<p>Travelling south:</p>
<p>Adelaide has three tram lines. The Botanic Gardens line runs from the Adelaide Entertainment Centre to the Botanic Gardens. The Glenelg line runs from the Royal Adelaide Hospital to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. The Festival Plaza line runs from Festival Plaza to Glenelg. The Railway Station is a convenient stop to transfer between the lines. Travel in the City between the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, Botanic Garden and South Terrace is free.</p>
<p>As well as being convenient for popular tourist destination Glenelg, the tram also stops at Rundle Mall, Victoria Square near the Adelaide Central Market and at North Terrace near Adelaide Railway Station. Travelling north on the tram takes you to Hindmarsh and Bowden, the home of the Adelaide Entertainment Centre venue for stadium concerts as well as a popular cafe and restaurant strip along Port Road and the side streets alongside.</p>
<p>If you're driving a car, a convenient and popular alternative to parking in the City is to park at the Entertainment Centre and catch the tram into the City. It only costs $4 for a whole weekday, which is much cheaper than city parking.</p>
<p>Adelaide has a comprehensive bus network centred in the City. Most main roads including cafe precincts like The Parade, Prospect Road, Henley Beach Road, King William Road and O'Connell St are 'Go Zones' which have regular buses on weekdays at least every 15 minutes until the early evening. Adelaide's bus network extends out to the outer suburbs, to the Adelaide Hills in the east, down to McLaren Vale in the south (although buses there are infrequent) and as far as Gawler in the north. It does not cover the Barossa Valley. Frequencies in the outer suburbs are much lower than in the City.</p>
<p>The O-Bahn is a bus rapid transit (BRT) line which runs along a guideway to Adelaide's north-eastern suburbs. O-Bahn buses run from Grenfell Street in the City, entering the O-Bahn at Hackney and stop at Klemzig, Paradise and Modbury Interchanges. After finishing on the O-Bahn, the buses drive the same as a regular bus to reach their destination. O-Bahn services are very frequent, as often as every 3 to 5 minutes during peak hour to interchanges and every 15 minutes off-peak.</p>
<p>The free City Connectors 98A, 98C, 99A and 99C (anti-clockwise and clockwise loops) each have about 30 stops taking in all the major cultural and commercial centres in the City, beginning at Victoria Square and including Adelaide Railway Station. The buses feature ground-level access ramps. They run every 30min on Monday to Friday from 8:30AM–7:00PM for the 99A, and from 8:15AM–7:15PM for the 99C. They do not operate on the weekend or on Christmas Day or Good Friday.</p>
<p>Be warned that bus frequency declines sharply after 7PM, with hourly intervals being typical in the outer suburbs, half hourly along Go Zones and every 15 minutes on the O-Bahn. All services cease operation around midnight, so check your timetables and expect to catch a taxi if required if you are out after this time. Very basic After Midnight bus services along limited routes operate hourly after midnight on Saturday nights only.</p>

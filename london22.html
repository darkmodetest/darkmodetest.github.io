Rides start from the southern end of Waterloo Bridge. The London Cycling Campaign is an advocacy group for London cyclists. With active local groups in most of the city's boroughs, it is recognised by the local and regional governments as the leading voice for cycling in the capital.</p>
<p>Normally a cyclist should keep to the left of the lane when cycling on a road with traffic, to allow faster-moving traffic to overtake. However, it is legal for a cycle to dominate a lane by maintaining a central road position like any other vehicle. This will make you unpopular with any traffic behind you but it is recommended in London on approach to right-hand turns at junctions. Making a right-hand turn from the normal left-position means crossing the lane of traffic, which may often ignore you and any turn signals you might have been using, leading to potential accidents.</p>
<p>Permission to take bikes on trains is very limited in London due to overcrowding. Non-folding bikes can be taken only on limited sections of the Tube network, mostly only on the above-ground sections outside peak hours. For this reason, folding bicycles are becoming increasingly popular. Most National Rail operators allow bicycles outside peak hours.</p>
<p>London offers a bicycle hire scheme known as Santander Cycles, operated by Transport for London. They are colloquially referred to as "Boris Bikes" after Boris Johnson, as they were introduced during his period as mayor of London. Docking stations can be found across Central London and slightly further out into areas such as Brixton, the Docklands, Hammersmith, and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.</p>
<p>The bikes, all coloured a distinctive red, can be unlocked at any hire dock and then ridden to wherever you want. After each journey the bike must be returned to a docking station on the network by locking the bike into the rack and receiving confirmation via a green light.</p>
<p>You pay via a credit or debit card and two payment plans exist: daily and yearly. A £2 daily plan (as of October 2020) gives access to the system for an unlimited number of rides for 24 hours. A fee for the first 30 minutes of each ride is included in the initial payment. For every other 30 minutes above that it costs extra £2. A yearly plan costs £90 for a full year.</p>
<p>The Santander Cycles app shows where bikes are available and can be used to make the hiring process faster, although sometimes the app doesn't show a journey as finished even if the bike was successfully docked back at a station. If in doubt it's better to check your activity log on the official site.</p>
<p>The Santander bikes' main competitor is Lime, whose fleet of electric bikes can be parked almost anywhere in much of Inner London, not just at docking stations. Download the app and set up a payment method first, then use your phone to scan a bike and unlock it. Rides are £1 plus £0.15 per minute (February 2021).</p>

<p>The rideshare apps Grab and GOJEK, which offer on-demand car and motorcycle taxis, are worth the cost of a SIM card: it is usually significantly cheaper than a regular taxi and has an upfront fare system with driver rating that eliminates scams. You'll be given the driver's name, photo and licence plate in advance, and can track them in real-time. Payment is through the app or in cash. Coverage is more limited much north of Denpasar, but you should be getting one in less than 15 minutes.</p>
<p>In areas such as Canggu, Jimbaran and Uluwatu, you will see informal signage saying that rideshare drivers are not allowed. These signs are erected by local taxi drivers who are upset that they now have a harder time charging tourists high fares. You may have success getting a rideshare in these locations anyway, but the driver may want you to be discreet. A couple of hotels and the airport prohibit them from picking up passengers; if you are confronted by the hotel or a regular taxi driver about this, saying that you have pre-arrangements with them for a day excursion may work. Requesting a pick-up around the corner from your intended spot will also help avoid a confrontation. It takes 20 minutes to walk out of the airport and the convoluted road is not convenient for suitcases. Grab Car is available 24 hours at Kuta, Seminyak, Legian, Denpasar and Sanur.</p>
<p>Bemos are minivans which serve as a flexible bus service and are Bali's "traditional" form of transportation. However they have largely given way to metered taxis in the south. Fares on shared bemos can be very cheap, but drivers will often insist that foreign tourists charter the entire vehicle, in which case they will usually ask for a price equivalent to a taxi or even more.</p>
<p>Many travellers seem to leave their brains at home when visiting Bali and think it's acceptable to ride a motorbike through extremely busy streets in a foreign land without wearing a helmet or drive a car without wearing a seatbelt. You'd be showing both a great deal of arrogance as a guest in a foreign country by thinking you are above the law of that country, and putting yourself at risk.</p>
<p>Police have been on the lookout for motorbike riders flouting helmet laws, and can fine them on the spot, whether foreigner or Indonesian. There are complaints of bribery or extortion, especially given the police officers' rudimentary English skills, but the smartest thing to do is to wear your helmet and ride carefully. If pulled over, show the required documents: the vehicle identification number and your IDP. If you do not have an International Driving Permit and a motorcycle licence from your home country, your travel insurance will not cover you if you need medical care after crashing your rented scooter.</p>
<p>Driving in Indonesia is on the left. Car and motorbike rentals are widely available but think very carefully about your ability to handle traffic in Bali with its different traffic rulesâ€”both formal and informal. Consider hiring a car and driver as you can relax, be safe and not get lost.</p>

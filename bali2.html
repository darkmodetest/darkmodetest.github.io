The Javanese Majapahit Empire's rule over Bali became complete in the 14th century when Gajah Mada, Prime Minister of the Javanese king, defeated the Balinese king at Bedulu.</p>
<p>The rule of the Majapahit Empire resulted in the initial influx of Javanese culture, most of all in architecture, dance, painting, sculpture and the wayang puppet theatre. All of this is still very apparent today.</p>
<p>The very few Balinese who did not adopt this Javanese Hindu culture are known today as the Bali Aga ("original Balinese") and still live in the isolated villages of Tenganan near Candidasa and Trunyan on the remote eastern shore of Lake Batur at Kintamani.</p>
<p>With the rise of Islam throughout the Indonesian archipelago, the Majapahit Empire in Java fell and Bali became independent near the turn of the 16th century. The Javanese aristocracy found refuge in Bali, bringing an even stronger influx of Hindu arts, literature and religion.</p>
<p>Divided among a number of ruling rajas (kings), occasionally battling off invaders from now Muslim Java to the west and making forays to conquer Lombok to the east, the north of the island was finally captured by Dutch colonialists in a series of brutal wars from 1846 to 1849. Southern Bali was not conquered until 1906, and eastern Bali did not surrender until 1908. In both 1906 and 1908, many Balinese chose death over disgrace and fought en masse until the bitter end, often walking straight into Dutch cannons and gunfire. This manner of suicidal fighting to the death was known as puputan. Victory was bittersweet, as the images of the puputan highly tarnished the Dutch in the international community.  Perhaps to make up for this, the Dutch did not make the Balinese enter into a forced cultivation system, as had happened in Java, and instead tried to promote Balinese culture through their policy of Baliseering or the "Balinisation of Bali".</p>
<p>In 1945, Bali became part of the newly independent Republic of Indonesia. After the 1965 coup d'Ã©tat that ushered in the Suharto regime, state-instigated, anticommunist violence spread across Indonesia. In Bali, it is said that the rivers ran red with the reprisal killings of suspected communists. The death toll is estimated to have been about 80,000 people, which was roughly 5% of Bali's population at the time.</p>
<p>The most recent chapter in Bali's history began in the 1970s when intrepid hippies and surfers discovered Bali's beaches and waves, and tourism soon became the biggest income earner. Despite the shocks of the terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005, the island continues to draw crowds, and Bali's culture is as magnificent as ever.</p>
<p>Unlike most other islands in largely Muslim Indonesia, Bali is a pocket of Hindu religion and culture. Every aspect of Balinese life is suffused with religion, but the most visible signs are the tiny offerings (canang sari) found in every Balinese house, workplace, restaurant, souvenir stall and airport check-in desk. These leaf trays are made daily and can contain an enormous range of offering items: flowers, glutinous rice, cookies, salt, and even cigarettes and coffee! They are set out with burning incense sticks and sprinkled with holy water at least three times a day before every meal. Don't worry if you kick or step on one accidentally, as they are placed on the ground for this very purpose and will be swept away anyway.</p>

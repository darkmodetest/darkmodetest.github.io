If cycling at night ensure you have lights bright enough to light your path.</p>
<p>It is illegal to ride bicycles on footpaths unless cycling with children under 12. In reality this is fairly weakly enforced out in the suburbs, but it is common for people to be fined for cycling through pedestrian malls in the city like Pitt St Mall or Martin Place. Out in the suburbs you can often follow quiet streets, and hop onto the footpath for a short stretch if things get too hairy. Bicycle helmets are required by law, as are lights and reflectors at night.</p>
<p>Bicycles can be taken on all trains, ferries and the metro for no cost. But catching a train in the CBD or close to the city in the peak may mean waiting for several services to find one you will fit. Check trackwork schedules on weekends, when buses replace trains and make taking bicycles more challenging.</p>
<p>Sydney centre now has Mobike dockless bike share scheme and Lime e-bikes if you don't feel like you've got your hill-legs. Simply download the app, pay a refundable deposit, and you can grab your closest bike. Park it anywhere you like. Longer term bike hire is available in many locations in Sydney. Unfortunately, bike hire for two bikes for a day usually costs more than hiring a small car and petrol for the day (around $50 per bike). However, for shorter periods some places may be reasonably priced (for example Sydney Olympic Park) charges $15 per hour. Also, you have to consider the additional cost if the bikes are stolen or damaged. However, they are much easier to park, are greener and can be more fun. See the district articles for bike hire listings.</p>
<p>If you want to join in a longer ride, most bicycle user groups around Sydney organise weekend rides for various levels of fitness. There is usually no charge to join in.</p>
<p>Sydney is quite pedestrian friendly, and as always you will see a lot more when moving around on foot than by wheels. On sunny days a long sleeved shirt, sunglasses, sunscreen and maybe even a hat is advisable. It takes some 45 minutes to walk from Central Station up through the CBD to the Opera House. For details on a self guided walking tour in Central Sydney, see Walking tour of Sydney. Even some more distant destinations are walkable if you have the time, fitness and inclination. It's less than 2 hours to walk through the exclusive eastern suburbs to Bondi Beach, or south through part industrial, part hipster Alexandria to the airport.</p>
<p>You can buy one and two day unlimited access passes to a range of sights and activities. There is also a "Sydney Attraction Pass" with five venues including Sydney wildlife and sealife (Darling Harbour), Sydney Tower and Madame Tussaud's. You have 30 days to visit (one pass per venue).</p>

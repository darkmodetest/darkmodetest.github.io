<p>In general, taxi drivers do not speak English or any other foreign language (e.g. Japanese), so have your destination written in Korean to show to the taxi driver. It is also wise to get your hotel's business card in case you get lost.</p>
<p>All taxis advertise a free interpretation service that can be called if you need help. The phone number for the interpretation is on the window sticker of the back seats. Taxis that have an "On Base Authorized" sticker on the side, or a green sticker on their front bumper, are capable of entering US military bases in Seoul. These drivers are required to speak better English as part of their contract and may thus be easier for any English speaking tourists.</p>
<p>All taxis in Seoul accept credit cards and T-money cards. However, drivers generally prefer that you pay cash, especially for shorter rides. You can also ask for your receipt ("Yeong-su-jeung" 영수증).</p>
<p>As in any other city, there are some bad apples, and some drivers may take you the long way. Although the drivers often have a GPS device on the dashboard of their car, this is relatively meaningless if you do not know the area or cannot speak sufficient Korean to argue the point.</p>
<p>In general, make sure the driver turns on the meter, get an idea of the cardinal direction of your destination (north, south, east, west), and use the interpretation service if you want to agree to a fare beforehand.</p>
<p>However, there is often road construction or protests around Seoul, so sometimes a long route is necessary. If you suspect you are being ripped off, the most a non-Korean speaker can do is write down or take a picture of the driver's ID (above the glove box) and report the details to the company.</p>
<p>Internationally known car rental companies can be found in Seoul; just be prepared for a driving challenge and long rush hours. In addition, parking spaces are hard, if not close to impossible to find, especially during peak hours. Therefore, unless you are planning to head out of the city, it is not advisable to rent a car and you are better off relying on the excellent public transport system instead.</p>
<p>There are many bike rental stations in Seoul (and other cities). Seoul City government operates Seoul Bike (nicknamed 따릉이 (Ttareungyi)), and you can get around easily at little cost. There are many voucher options, but a day voucher is enough for most tourists. At the homepage or official app, purchase the voucher and receive the rental number. At the nearby rental spot, press the button on the bike you want to rent and type the digits. You have to return the bike to the rental station within 1 hour (2 hours if you bought the Premium voucher). You can rent it as many times as you want for 24 hours, as long as you return the bike for respective period of time. A regular voucher is ₩1,000 and a premium one is ₩2,000.</p>

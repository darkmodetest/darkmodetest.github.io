The German Centre is supported by German government institutions and offers market knowledge and advice to entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>In Beijing, as in much of China, finding a job teaching English at a training center is relatively easy for native speakers, making it a popular option for South Africans. However, if you're aiming to work at an international school, employers typically require teaching credentials from your home country or several years of teaching experience. Additionally, policies aimed at reducing the cost of raising children generally discourage hiring foreign teachers in schools. Non-native speakers, even from other Western countries, should be cautious about teaching English jobs, as strict enforcement of regulations includes the risk of administrative detention for violations.</p>
<p>Beijing is home to many high-net-worth households and offers a plethora of upscale shopping destinations with mostly local shoppers as well as a tourist-oriented shopping experience.</p>
<p>Two classic shopping areas that have evolved into high-end districts filled with brand-name stores are Xidan Commercial Street in the Xicheng District west of the central axis, and Wangfujing in the Dongcheng District to the east. Wangfujing is the larger shopping area. This expansive pedestrian street spans several blocks and is lined with numerous shopping complexes, including the landmark Wangfujing Department Store with its clocktower overlooking the bustling avenue. Big-name brands are well represented here, with dueling flagship Huawei and Apple stores facing each other across the street. The Wangfujing Bookstore offers a limited selection of English-language books, mostly classic titles like Hamlet or 1984, and is a good place to take kids due to its large children's area.</p>
<p>For a taste of Beijing's local trendy consumer scene, head to Taikoo Li in the Sanlitun neigbhorhood. Along with Sanlitun Soho across the street, it forms a hub intersection perfect for people-watching. Entering Taikoo Li feels like stepping onto a runway—the narrow walkway from the main intersection opens into a spacious outdoor mall. The path is buzzing with activity as a group of photographers with long lens cameras snap pictures of fashionable girls. The purpose of these impromptu photoshoots remains a mystery, but they contribute to the lively scene. Nearby is Parkview Green, a distinctive high-end mall filled with contemporary art installations and featuring a charming café on the 10th floor. Both destinations are located in the Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>Beijing boasts markets with cultural goods including silk clothing, table settings, porcelain, teas, and other traditional items. In Xicheng District, Dashilar Commercial Street is a historic hub for traditional Chinese goods, while Liulichang Culture Street is known for its offerings in calligraphy, paintings, and books. Over in Chaoyang District, the Panjiayuan Market is famous for cultural gifts and imitation antiques.</p>
<p>The Hongqiao Pearl Market, located directly east of the Temple of Heaven, is known for pearl jewelry on the upper floors and a trove of tourist-oriented goods on the lower levels, including souvenirs, electronics, tea, luggage, clothing, tailor shops, silk carpets, and counterfeit luxury handbags. Haggling is essential at the Pearl Market; start bargaining at about one-third of the vendor's initial asking price. The Silk Street Market (秀水街), once a bustling hub for counterfeit goods and the quintessential spot for driving a hard bargain in Beijing, now operates more like a regular shopping center with English signage.</p>

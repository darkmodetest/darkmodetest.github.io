Stores are run by the park concessionaire (Aramark), the Yosemite Conservancy, or the Ansel Adams Gallery, with a few smaller family stores. Aramark, YC, and the Ansel Adams Gallery offer some form of mail order. The Yosemite Conservancy stores specialize in educational materials about Yosemite, many of which are published by the organization; membership offers a 15% discount on most purchases.</p>
<p>Gas is available for purchase at Crane Flat, Tuolumne Meadows, Wawona, and in towns outside of the park. Gas prices tend to be 60 cents to 1 dollar higher than communities like Fresno, Merced, and Modesto.</p>
<p>Groceries can be purchased in Yosemite Village, Crane Flat, Curry Village, Wawona, and Tuolumne Meadows.</p>
<p>Demand for lodging in Yosemite Valley in both the hotels and the campgrounds is extremely heavy during the peak season, so you need to book well ahead of time during the late spring, summer and early fall; vacancies are more common during the off-season. As an example, by mid-May in 2015 not a single reservation remained in any campground for any night during the summer season. Cancellations occur on a random basis, so it is also advised to call back frequently for a desired reservation date.</p>
<p>Cheaper and more abundant lodging can be found outside the park. The nearby towns of El Portal, Mariposa, Groveland, Fish Camp, and Lee Vining have lodging. In addition, the community of Yosemite West borders the park and offers numerous rentals; it is accessible only from within Yosemite and provides a convenient option to visitors planning to stay near Wawona or Yosemite Valley. Be aware that despite names like "Yosemite View", no lodging outside the park has a view of the Valley. Lodging is particularly close to the park near the Route 140 entrance and the Route 120 East entrance; for those approaching from the Route 41South entrance, there are many affordable lodging options in Oakhurst, but at the cost of a longer commute distance. In addition, Yosemite is surrounded by national forests that offer numerous campgrounds.</p>
<p>The following lodging options are operated by the National Park Service through a concessionaire.</p>
<p>In addition to the lodging operated through the park service, there are also a handful of private cabins within the park boundaries that can be rented.</p>
<p>Camping is by far the cheapest way of staying within the park, but campgrounds fill quickly during summer months and may require making reservations months in advance. Reservations can be made through the National Park Service from 7AM-7PM Pacific time, or by calling ☏ +1-877-444-6777 or ☏ +1 518-885-3639 from outside the United States. Written reservation requests can be made by including desired location, type of equipment you will be camping in (i.e., tent, RV, etc.), as well as method of payment. Send written requests to NPRS, P.O. Box 1600, Cumberland, MD 21502.</p>
<p>All campgrounds offer bear-safe food storage containers, tap water (except where noted), and flush toilets. Pay showers and laundry are in Curry Village in Yosemite Valley. During summer, showers are also available afternoons at Tuolumne Meadows Lodge.</p>

Today, most inhabitants speak French in daily life. The Brussels dialect, a Brabantian dialect of Dutch, can be heard, especially in the outer districts of Brussels-Capital Region.  The French spoken is standard French.  Dutch speakers speak standard Dutch but many also speak a different variety when talking to people from their region.</p>
<p>English has become a common spoken language because of the international institutions based in Brussels, such as the European Commission, the European Parliament and NATO. It is still relatively rare to find written tourist or general information in English, although the situation is changing. Public announcements in train stations are given in at least French and Dutch, while larger train stations (such as Zuidstation/Gare du Midi) typically include English and German. English is also used on metros, trams and buses, announced last for information such as line transfers and terminal stops. Do not hesitate to ask someone if you do not understand what has been said.</p>
<p>Considering the city's location and that it markets itself as the capital of Europe, spoken English is less prevalent in Belgium than in its Dutch neighbour. However, even if it is not as widely spoken as one may expect, it is nonetheless widely understood. As is often the case elsewhere, success in finding someone who speaks English depends on several factors such as age (14- to 35-year-olds are most likely to speak English), education and previous experience abroad.</p>
<p>German is also an official language in Belgium spoken as a mother tongue by about 70,000 people in the east of the country bordering Germany, but the only German you're likely to hear in Brussels would be overheard on the streets around the European institutions or by German tourists, even if there is a large German population residing there.</p>
<p>Other languages that are increasingly heard in Brussels include Arabic (at least 25% of Brussels' population is of Arab descent, chiefly from Morocco), Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, and Russian.</p>
<p>50.9013894.4844441  Brussels Airport (BRU  IATA also referred to as Brussels National or Zaventem after the municipality it is in). This is Brussels' main airport. It has good train connections with the rest of Belgium, and with many European capitals and other major cities.   (updated Nov 2022)</p>
<p>Belgium's flag carrier Brussels Airlines, which operates an extensive network of flights within Europe, also offers long-haul flights from North America and, quite uniquely for a European airline, many African destinations - especially in the former Belgian colony DR Congo. Major North American carriers also offer flights to Brussels, as do a few Asian ones. Direct connections from Asia are decent, while those from Latin America are almost non-existent, so you most likely have to change at an intermediate airport, and may want to consider using one of the Middle Eastern carriers (Emirates, Etihad and Qatar all serve Brussels) or change in one of Europe's major hubs like  London Heathrow,  Frankfurt,  Paris Charles de Gaulle or  Schiphol. The latter two have a direct train to Brussels. Turkish Airways (via  Istanbul-Atatürk) and Finnair (via Helsinki) also have particularly developed networks of connections from the Far East, while Madrid is the best option to fly from Latin America.</p>

If the taxi arrives later than ten minutes, the fee will be waived.  Normal bookings can still be placed 24 hours in advance at no additional cost.</p>
<p>Renting a car is the ideal means of transportation for travelling through the suburbs and to outlying attractions. Most major car hire companies have locations in Perth city and the airport. Unlike the east coast, Perth's major freeways and highways are free from any tolls, and it is possible to be surrounded by beautiful countryside within minutes.</p>
<p>Driving into Perth's CBD and Northbridge will mean paying to park, which can cost up to $40 a day on a weekday. There is also congestion on roads leading to the CBD during peak hours. The other option is to park at a railway station and catch a train. Some stations charge a small fee for parking, and all-day parking can fill up. Once parked in the CBD, you can reach most destinations by foot or by a free bus.</p>
<p>The speed limit within built-up areas is 50 km/h unless otherwise directed by traffic signs. On major State Highways, such as 3, 4, 7 and 8, the speed limit can quickly go from 100 km/h, to 60 km/h. Be aware, and unlike Sydney or Albury, the maximum urban speed limit is 100 km/h, unless in the very very outer suburbs (1 Forrest Highway or 94 GEH). Police are rarely seen out on the roads but speed cameras are very prevalent. Driving even 5 km/hr above the speed limit can incur a fine. Driving 40 km/hr above the speed limit means the car is impounded for 28 days even if it is not your car (hire cars excepted).</p>
<p>Perth can be comfortably explored by bicycle as the city has some of the best cycling infrastructure in Australia.</p>
<p>The city features:</p>
<p>Cycle maps are available from most bike shops, and at Transport Maps.  The Department of Transport provides a range of guides, maps and brochures for bike riders.  If you have a scenic route in mind, these brochures can take you to the coast, Kings Park, Armadale and the Hills or around the Swan River.</p>
<p>A favourite among seasoned local cyclists is the ride along the North side of the Swan River between the City and Nedlands. Allow 60 min for a round trip along this route, as you might encounter a strong headwind.</p>
<p>Bicycles are allowed on board Transperth trains but not during peak hour unless they can be folded up.</p>
<p>Top sights in and around the city are:</p>
<p>Outside of the metropolitan area are some unspoilt national parks, unpopulated coasts and other interesting locations.</p>
<p>There is a designated area in the zoo for kangaroos where they can wander on visitors' paths. The animals are used to people, so you can see them very close.</p>
<p>To see semi-wild kangaroos, visit the Pinnaroo Valley Memorial Park (a cemetery, but not European style). It's in walking distance from Whitfords Transperth Train/Metro Station - just cross the highway, the highway exit and look for the entrance on the left. As there is plenty of space for them, you may see them not only eating but also hopping.</p>

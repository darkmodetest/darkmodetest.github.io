If none of the 80 museums would be of interest then a visit to the 50.8934144.3373145 Planetarium  or watching an action movie in 4D in the mega cinema complex 50.8939424.3421626 Kinepolis can be indoor alternatives. For more adventurous water fans, Nemo 33 offers a diving challenge in the second deepest heated indoor swimming pool in the world at 34.5 metres (113 ft) and 30°C (86°F)</p>
<p>If you prefer to get submerged into local culture, try one of the Brussels themed room escape games of 50.844474.355237 Enygma near the city centre, and puzzle your way out within the hour. For fans of Brussels many culinary delicacies, following a beer brewing or waffle baking workshop are tasty activities for an afternoon, alone or in a group. To keep up to date with what's going on, pick up a copy of local free city newspaper Zone 02. Another good free listings paper is Agenda, which is distributed together with the Dutch-language weekly Brussel Deze Week and has the notable advantage of being published in three languages (English, Dutch, French). You can find them in many cafés and restaurants around the city.</p>
<p>Football: the men's national soccer team play at King Baudouin Stadium in Heysel. Three Brussels clubs play in First Division A, the top tier: RSC Anderlecht in Anderlecht district, Union SG in Forest, and R.W.D. Molenbeek in Molenbeek-Saint-Jean.</p>
<p>Very few shops in Brussels open before 10:00, and most open 10:30-11:00. Many shops are closed on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Brussels is chock full of chocolates, but the ultimate indulgence for the chocoholic is Place du Grand Sablon-Grote Zavel Plein, where you will find three shops selling some of the best chocolate in the world:  Neuhaus, Pierre Marcolini and Wittamer.  Each store has its own specialties: Pierre Marcolini's take-away cakes and ice cream are reasons to be tempted, while Wittamer is the only one with a cafe on premises and also sells the ultimate hot chocolate. Passion Chocolat (20 Rue Vanderlindenstraat) is a bit out of the way but its artisan chocolate is worth a visit, and you can taste lots of it for free at the entrance.</p>
<p>There is plenty of good eating to be had in Brussels. Most people concentrate on the three classics: mussels (moules in French and mosselen in Dutch), fries (frites in French and frieten in Dutch) and chocolate.  A few more adventurous Bruxellois/Brusselse dishes include anguilles au vert/paling in 't groen (river eels in green sauce), meat balls in tomato sauce, stoemp (mashed vegetables and potatoes) and turbot waterzooi (turbot fish in cream and egg sauce). For dessert, try a Belgian waffle (wafel in Dutch and gauffre in French), also available in a square Brussels version dusted with powdered sugar, and choices of bananas, whipped cream and many other toppings. Although many prefer the round, caramelized version from Liège. Many tourist shops will sell the Liège waffle (traditionally eaten plain, as it already contains pearl sugar in the dough) with toppings. Only the Brussels waffle (which has a lighter/airier dough) will have toppings such as whipped cream, fruits, etc.</p>

This is especially the case for tracks in the parks located outside the Canberra urban area. If you're walking in those areas, carry an alternate form of communication such as a personal locator beacon in case you or a member of your party needs assistance.</p>
<p>Do not swim in the lakes (including Lake Burley Griffin) until you check online, as poor water quality can make doing so unsafe. Few Canberrans ever swim in the lakes due to algal blooms in summer, but water quality is now better than it used to be.</p>
<p>Death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are common in many Canberra suburbs, and ingestion of even one can cause death</p>
<p>Being the "bush capital", you might encounter wildlife, even in the city areas. An eastern grey kangaroo can grow over 2 metres tall, taller than a very tall man, and can seriously injure you. Do not get too close, especially to a mother with a joey, and appreciate them from a distance. Keep an eye out for kangaroos and other wildlife when driving, especially at night.</p>
<p>The ACT is the only place in Australia where the use of cannabis has been decriminalised. However, the rules around this are restrictive. There are no criminal penalties for the personal possession or use of small quantities of cannabis in private homes. Buying, selling and gifting cannabis or using it a public place remain criminal offenses.</p>
<p>The ACT government also decriminalised the possession of small quantities of many other drugs in 2023. Possession of these drugs remain illegal, but is punished through a fine, a caution or a requirement to attend a drug diversion program. Selling drugs and driving under the influence of drugs continue to be serious criminal offenses.</p>
<p>Free Wi-Fi is available in Civic, the town centres and some other areas of Canberra through the CBRfree service provided by the ACT Government.</p>
<p>The National Library of Australia provides free Wi-Fi and free internet access on 40 computer terminals (webmail is blocked on some computers, so ask the staff to show you which ones you can access webmail from).</p>
<p>All the ACT public library branches have free Wi-Fi and computers. Membership or proof that you are not a resident of the ACT is required to use the computers, and you may have to book a few hours in advance due to high demand.</p>
<p>Maccas restaurants in Australia offer free Wi-Fi, no purchase required. The restaurants in Civic are at: corner East Row & Alinga St, and corner Cooyong Street & Northbourne Avenue.</p>
<p>A large number of countries maintain missions in Canberra. Note however that some do not offer consular services, with these being provided through consulates located in other Australian cities. Several countries have their mission to Australia located elsewhere, typically Sydney or Melbourne. The Department of Foreign Affairs maintains a complete list of foreign missions in Australia and their contact details on its website.</p>
<p>Several of the embassies located in Yarralumla are tourist attractions in their own right due to their architecture.</p>

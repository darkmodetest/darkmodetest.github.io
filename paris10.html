<p>Ticket inspectors roam the network and show no mercy to tourists pleading ignorance. Travelling without a ticket will result in you being cited and forced to pay a fine on the spot. Inspections usually take place behind the turnstiles at major metro stations or during transfers.</p>
<p>There are several excellent boat services which make use of the Seine. As well as providing easy, cheap transport to much of central Paris, excellent photo opportunities abound. You can buy a day or 3 day ticket and hop on and off the boat as needed. The boats take a circular route from the Eiffel Tower, down past the Louvre, Notre Dame, botanical gardens then back up the other bank past Musée d'Orsay.  Batobus offers a regular shuttle service between the main tourist sights (closed Jan); other companies such as the famous Bateaux Mouches offer sightseeing cruises.</p>
<p>If the sign is green, the cab is available, if it is red, the cab is busy, if it is off, the cab is off</p>
<p>Taxis are comparatively cheap especially at night when there are no traffic jams to be expected. There are not as many as one would expect, and sometimes finding a taxi can be challenging. In the daytime, it is not always a good idea to take a taxi, as walking or taking the metro (See: Métro) will often be faster. If you know you will need one to get to the airport, or to a meeting, it is wise to book ahead by phone.</p>
<p>The initial fare is €2.40 and the meter increases by around €1.10 each kilometer and around 50 cents each minute spent at red lights or in traffic jams. Fares are fixed by the city law and every driver complies with them. Fares vary according to the day of the week, the hour of the day and the area you're crossing. If you call a taxi, the meter starts when you call and not when you get in. You should expect a €5 to €10 fare on the meter when the taxi arrives after you call it.</p>

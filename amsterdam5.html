And then an InterCity (every 30min) for €11-19 or Flixbus to Amsterdam . (updated Feb 2024)</p>
<p>Frequently served intercity bus stops are:</p>
<p>There are dozens of daily international bus services, many of which serve countries immigrants originate from. Nearby international destinations in Germany, Belgium and France (Paris and Lille) and London are served at high frequency. Their stops and stations are located at the Amsterdam Sloterdijk Station, the airport and/or another locations:</p>
<p>There are only a few long-distance national bus services in the Netherlands, and apparently none to Amsterdam Centraal. Bus 300 connects Haarlem train station with Hoofddorp, Schiphol Airport, Amstelveen and Amsterdam Bijlmer-ArenA.</p>
<p>The western part of the Netherlands has a dense (and congested) road network. Coming from the east (Germany), motorway  directly leads to Amsterdam. If you're taking motorway  from Arnhem, change in Utrecht onto the A2 in the northern direction. From the south (Belgium), follow motorways A16, A27 and A2, in that order in northern direction. From The Hague, the  leads to Amsterdam. All motorways to Amsterdam connect to the Ring motorway, the . From this motorway, main roads lead radially into Amsterdam (the roads S101 through S118).</p>
<p>In most cases, you'll want to avoid getting into the area enclosed by the ring road. Traffic is dense and parking spaces are expensive and difficult to find. Instead, when on the A10, follow the signs to one of the P+R-spots (P+R Zeeburg to the east, P+R ArenA to the southeast, P+R Olympisch Stadion to the south, P+R Noord to the north, and P+R Sloterdijk to the west). Here you can park your car and take public transport to the city centre for a single fare. There is a flat rate of €8 a day with public transport to the city centre for up to 5 persons included. You can park for free at a few places that have metro or tram stops nearby (e.g. IKEA near metro station Bullewijk).</p>
<p>The speed limit on Dutch motorways is 100 km/h during the day and 130 km/h during the night, except where indicated. On the A10 ring motorway around Amsterdam, the maximum speed is 100 km/h, and 80 km/h on the Western section. These limits are strictly enforced and there are many speed cameras.</p>
<p>The 52.3779724.9152876 Passenger Terminal Amsterdam is close to the city centre but is only used for cruise ships. The nearest ferry port is IJmuiden, where ferries from Newcastle upon Tyne dock. DFDS Seaways offers daily overnight ferry services from Newcastle upon Tyne (more specifically, North Shields) in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Other ferry services dock at Rotterdam Europoort (ferry from Hull) and Hook of Holland (ferry from Harwich). These are about 70 km away from Amsterdam. Intercity and Inter Regional trains run direct from Amsterdam Central Station to Rotterdam Central Station every 10 to 15 minutes taking approximately 1hr 15 minutes. See the National train operator NS website for booking and information.</p>
<p>For the Stena Line ferry to Harwich: from Rotterdam Central, change for Rotterdam Metro Line B direct to Hoek Van Holland Station where you will be able to walk onto the Ferry. See Rotterdam RET website for tickets and information. For P&O to Hull: there is no public transport however Taxis are readily available at Rotterdam Central. P&O offer some coach options via their website.</p>

<p>The National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks on five days every year:</p>
<p>A useful way to orient yourself is to visualize the roads inside Yellowstone as making a "figure-8" shape. The lower loop, West Thumb - Old Faithful - Madison - Norris - Canyon - Lake Village - West Thumb, is about 90 miles (140 kilometres) around. The upper loop, Norris - Mammoth - Tower-Roosevelt - Canyon - Norris, is about 70 miles (110 kilometres) around. The park is large.</p>
<p>Most visitors use private vehicles to get around inside Yellowstone National Park.  Roads can become very crowded whenever people stop to view wildlife; use pullouts, and be respectful of other motorists to help avoid bear-jams.  When snow falls roads may be closed, and during winter months many park roads close permanently.</p>
<p>There is no public transportation available within the park.  Xanterra Resorts provides bus tours within the park during the summer season.  The Lower Loop Tour departs from locations in the southern part of the Park only.  The Upper Loop Tour departs from Lake Hotel, Fishing Bridge RV Park, and Canyon Lodge to tour the northern section of the park only.  The Grand Loop Tour departs from Gardiner and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel to tour the entire park in one day.  During the winter season snowcoach tours are provided from various locations.  Call +1 307 344-7311 for information or reservations.</p>
<p>In addition, during the summer season, commercial businesses offer tours originating from many area towns and cities.  During the winter season, some businesses provide snowcoach tours for most park roads or bus transportation on the Mammoth Hot Springs to Cooke City road.</p>
<p>Cycling in the park can be a very rewarding experience, but due to the great distances in the park some additional planning is necessary to ensure that lodging is available each night.  The park reserves a number of campsites for cyclists, but during the busy summer season it is probably best to reserve sites in advance wherever possible.</p>
<p>Winter is perhaps the most tranquil time to visit the park when there are the fewest visitors.  The winter use season of snowmobile and snowcoach travel begins in mid-December and ends in mid-March. Actual opening or closing dates for oversnow travel varies by entrance and will be determined by adequate snowpack and plowing schedules.  Visitors wishing to visit the park on a snowmobile or in a snowcoach must either travel by commercial snowcoach or accompany a commercial guide on snowmobiles (private, unguided snowmobiles or snowcoaches are not allowed) which are available at most entrances. Best Available Technology snowmobiles are required, and there is a daily limit on snowmobile and snowcoach entries. Off-road use of snowmobiles and snowcoaches is prohibited.</p>

Yellowstone is world-famous for its natural heritage and beauty - and for the fact that it holds half the world's geothermal features, with more than 10,000 examples. Travelers to Yellowstone can view more than 300 geysers (such as "Old Faithful"), pools of boiling mud, and an amazing assemblage of wildlife, such as grizzly bears, wolves, bison and elk, all while standing on the surface of the Earth's largest known "super-volcano".</p>

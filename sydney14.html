Enforcement is mainly by fixed speed cameras, but also by mobile speed cameras (from a speed-camera equipped vehicle parked at the roadside), hand-operated speed "guns" operated by police, and by police highway patrol cars. Speed cameras are installed at many traffic-light controlled intersections, and these cameras also enforce the "stop at red lights" by taking two pictures, the first of the car crossing the stop line (painted on the road) while the light is at red, and the second as the car passes through the intersection (thus proving that it was not simply a case of the car stopping a metre or so past the stop line).</p>
<p>Breaking the speed limit by 10 km/h or less attracts a fine (as at Jan 2018) of $116, by 11-20 km/hr a fine of $269, by 21-30 km/h $462, by 31-45 km/h $884, and over 45 km/h $2,384 with immediate on-the-spot confiscation of driver's licence. Penalties are higher for inexperienced drivers, and in school zones during enforcement hours on school days. In addition, scaled "demerit points" are given to Australian licence holders, resulting in an automatic non-appealable 3 month or 6 month licence suspension when a pre-determined number of demerit points are accumulated by a driver within any 3 year period. Demerit point penalties are doubled during school holidays and during public holiday weekends.</p>
<p>If you are a fit and experienced urban cyclist, used to riding on multi-lane roads in heavy traffic, then just get on your bike. Cyclists are permitted just about everywhere on Sydney's roads, except for some freeway tunnels where bicycle signs will usually direct you to the alternative route. Kerbside lanes are often narrow, so ride assertively, be seen, and take the full lane when you know there is insufficient room to be passed. Bikes are permitted in bus lanes (like the city streets), but not bus only lanes (like the Harbour Bridge, and T-ways).</p>
<p>The city centre is not particularly cyclist friendly traffic-wise. It is not flat either - you can expect regular hills but no marathon uphill climbs. The weather is, however, usually good for cycling.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a quieter ride, a number of quiet on-road and shared pedestrian/cycle paths are available, but can be hard to find. A good place to start is at Sydney Olympic Park where you can get your cycle legs on the extensive off-road trails; then, if you want to, you can follow the Parramatta River to Parramatta or following the Cooks River to Botany Bay in Southern Sydney. The Harbour Bridge has a dedicated cycle lane, suitable for all ages, but as soon as you get off the bridge (and down the steps!) you are back onto urban streets in Milsons Point.</p>
<p>The Bourke St cycleway is a northâ€“south route in the City East and a cruisy place to cycle between Woolloomooloo, Darlinghurst and Surry Hills. Lots of shade and cafes to break the trip. Some other separated cycleways have opened in the CBD, but they are yet to form a cohesive network, and your trip may easily end up on a busy and unforgiving city road if you haven't planned well in advance.</p>

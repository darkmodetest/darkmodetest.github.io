Read the warnings on the signage and ride with care. The official app shows the location of rental station and how many bikes are there, so plan your journey while knowing where to return. Naver map or Kakao map can show the bike routes and have a direction search option for bikes. If you know the Korean, you can use the weekly, monthly, and yearly option.</p>
<p>There are also private bike rentals at Han river park and Yeoido. They offer electric bikes, two-person bikes, and four-person bike. These bikes usually cost around ₩5,000 per hour.</p>
<p>Shared electric scooters are available for rent with a driver's license. It is mandatory to wear a helmet and you can be fined by the police if you don't. Rates vary by scooter manufacturer, but you can expect to pay roughly ₩300-500 to unlock and ₩1,000-1,200 per minute of us (June 2024).</p>
<p>You have to download the app released by each manufacturer and use it after authentication. A shared mobility company called SWING has launched shared scooters. SWING charges</p>
<p>Getting around in Seoul without a local escort (be it friend or cab driver) can be tricky, since this is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. While Seoul occupies less land than New York City, it can be more confusing. The major roads twist and turn, the various rail lines, rivers and mountains are obstacles and the smaller roads turn into a labyrinth of alleys. Learn the landmarks and subway station closest to where you are staying. The better-known landmarks in Seoul (such as the N Seoul Tower in the center of town) can prove helpful at times. Google Maps is not that useful in South Korea, due to laws forbidding use of geographical information by foreign companies. Use Naver map or Kakao map, since these support English.</p>
<p>Once you know your immediate surroundings, you'll find that Seoul isn't such a huge place and the pedestrian approach can be an enriching experience. There's usually a subway stop within a ten-minute walk in any direction. And you can see the local map at the exit of the station.</p>
<p>Whether on bicycle or foot, the best way to escape traffic is to learn the rivers and streams. Most of these waterways empty into the Han River or another tributary to the Han, so look to the direction of water flow at any creek; chances are, it's headed for the Han. The Han runs right through town, generally moving West (sometimes Southwest; sometimes Northwest), so knowing where you are in relation to the Han is helpful. The Han River as well as most streams are lined with massive parks that feature outdoor gymnasiums, multiple-lane bicycle paths, and 24-hour restrooms. Pedestrian bridges on the smaller waterways are common. Also, numerous mountains with hiking trails can be found in the city.</p>
<p>As elsewhere in Korea, a grasp of basic Korean will be helpful. If you plan on an extended visit, consider learning to read the Korean alphabet, hangul. It takes very little time to pick up the basics, and it can be immensely helpful.  A quick (free) visit to the Story of King Sejong Exhibition Hall beneath the Statue of King Sejong in Gwanghwamun Square will give you an introduction to the Korean alphabet and some interactive exhibits to practice. Thirty minutes there will see you recognizing and pronouncing some Korean words.</p>

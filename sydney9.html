If you want to go a long distance and can see the next bus is full, you can consider waiting for the next one.</p>
<p>There are four light rail lines operating in Sydney.</p>
<p>The  L1  Dulwich Hill Line runs from Central to Dulwich Hill. This line is useful for travelling between Sydney City and western Darling Harbour, the casino, the Fish Markets, Pyrmont, and the Inner West. Be aware that the light rail to Darling Harbour and the Casino can get extremely crowded, even on Sundays. If you're only going a short distance (Central to Paddy's Market, for example), it'd be faster to walk instead. Beyond the casino is a spacious ride through the inner west.</p>
<p>The  L2  Randwick Line runs down George St, connecting Circular Quay to Central, before continuing on to Surry Hills, Moore Park, and Randwick.</p>
<p>The  L3  Kingsford Line branches off from the  L2  at Moore Park and heads to Kingsford.</p>
<p>The  L4  Westmead and Carlingford Line winds its way through the various hospital precincts in Westmead, past Parramatta CBD, before following the old Carlingford line to Carlingford.</p>
<p>Unlike buses, the Opal card readers are located at the stops and not on the light rails themselves, so don't forget to tap on and off before and after your ride.</p>
<p>The public Sydney Ferries central hub is at Circular Quay at the north edge of the CBD. Ferries run up the Parramatta River via Balmain and Olympic Park, around to Darling Harbour, across to Luna Park, across to the Zoo, out to Manly, and out to Watsons Bay. They also go to Garden island and Cockatoo Island. They run only within Sydney harbour, so you can't get a ferry to Bondi. Ferries run to most destinations at least every hour, with additional peak services, and half hourly services to Manly and Barangaroo/Pyrmont Bay.</p>
<p>At Circular Quay and Barangaroo, each wharf has a large screen showing ferry departures and general information. Find your destination on the screen, which shows when your ferry service is departing and from which wharf. Note that at Circular Quay, it will show the services for all nine lines, however, in Barangaroo, only  F3 , and  F4  are shown.</p>
<p>More than just a utilitarian means of transport, ferries are a great way to see Sydney Harbour. The best ferry excursion for visitors is the  F1  Circular Quay eastward to Manly or, for a shorter and slightly cheaper trip, the  F9  to Watsons Bay. Be prepared to take photographs of the Sydney Opera House and the Harbour Bridge as you leave Circular Quay. Ferries from Circular Quay westward to Balmain and Barangaroo offer great excuses to experience sailing under the Harbour Bridge. The  F2  Taronga Zoo ferry line is also an experience for some, and offers a direct ferry line from Circular Quay to Taronga Zoo, the iconic zoo of Sydney.</p>
<p>The Manly and inner-harbour ( F1 ,  F5 ,  F6 ,  F7 ) ferries can get busy, but it is very rare that they reach capacity. Opal's $2.60 Sunday deal is very popular, especially on sunny 'beach' days, with the viewing decks becoming tightly packed and the queuing chaotic. If you're only in Sydney a short time, then you may wish to spend the extra to travel on weekday and avoid the associated hassles with crowds on a Sunday.</p>

These are designated by green and yellow slant stripes, spot these stripes on the station walls and you'll know where the ladies compartment is. These are generally less crowded and safer. But very late at night, it might actually be safer to travel by the general coach than the first-class women's coach, as the latter may be absolutely empty except for you. From 11:15PM-6:30PM the ladies compartment towards the northern end is open to the general public. Sometimes they have a cop guarding the coaches, but sometimes they won't. Use your judgement.</p>
<p>The modern Mumbai Metro is expanding rapidly and offers by far the most comfortable rides in the city. As of 2024 its four lines serve only the northern parts of the city and are of limited use to most visitors.  This will change sometime in 2025-26 when Line 3 (Aqua), which runs from Aarey via the airport to Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), is extended all the way to the southernmost tip of Mumbai at Colaba.</p>
<p>While there is talk of unified ticketing, for time being each metro operator has its own ticketing and app systems.  Fares range from ₹10-50 depending on distance.</p>
<p>Mumbai has India's only monorail system, it has one line and eighteen stations. Underused and derided even by locals as a line from nowhere to nowhere, the fare is between ₹5 and ₹11 depending on your destination station.</p>
<p>These are a few intra-city ferry services:</p>
<p>Travel agents and hotels can arrange private chauffeur-driven cars to provide services. Expensive by comparison with taxis, they are the most trusted, secure, and comfortable way to travel around the city. Driving in Mumbai can be difficult, because of poor driver discipline, but chauffeur-driven services are very reasonable. These can be arranged by travel companies or online from the countries of origin. Car rental agencies also have services in Mumbai.</p>
<p>Mumbai is India's melting pot — a confluence of people from various parts of India, but dominant are people from the west, then north, and followed by the south. Marathi is the state and city official language used by State Government agencies, municipal authorities, and the local police, and also the first language of most locals.</p>
<p>However, being one of India's largest cities and main commercial centre, Mumbai is now also home to migrants from other parts of India who do not speak Marathi. A local variant of Hindi, with strong Bollywood influence, called Mumbaiya Hindi (or Bambaiya Hindi), serves as the "lingua franca". Although almost everyone can understand standard Hindi, you may get an interesting reply from some. Most educated locals will be well versed in Marathi, Hindi and English.</p>
<p>English is widely used in the corporate world and in banking and trading. In most places, you will be able to get by with Hindi and English, as most people you will encounter can communicate in broken English at the very least. However, expect to hear more regional languages including Gujarati.</p>
<p>The names of Mumbai's monuments tell us the story of which way political winds were blowing when they were built. In the late 19th century the British named everything after their Queen, so we had Victoria Terminus, Victoria Gardens and Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute (built in 1887 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Her Majesty's coronation). In the early 20th century, they named everything after the Prince of Wales.</p>

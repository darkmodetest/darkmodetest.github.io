The Anangu believe this space is actually hollow but it contains an energy source and marks the spot where their dreamtime began. They also believe that the area around Uluru is the home of their ancestors and is inhabited by many ancestral beings.</p>
<p>Kata Tjuṯa is a collection of 36 variously-sized rock domes 36 km (22 mi) to the west of Uluru. Some geologists believe that it once may have been a monolith far surpassing Uluru in size, but that it eroded to several separate bulks of rock.</p>
<p>The park protects hundreds of plant species, 24 native mammal species and 72 reptile species. To protect these, off-road access away from Uluru and Kata Tjuta is not allowed.</p>

<p>Check the seven-day weather forecast for Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park on the Bureau of Meteorology.</p>
<p>In December and January, the temperature can be blistering hot with temperatures exceeding 45 °C, and occasionally tipping over 50, and some areas may be closed for travellers' safety. July and August can see minimum overnight temperatures drop to as low as minus 10°, with day time maximums occasionally only reaching as high as 15°. April and September offer a more temperate climate, although still warm enough to work up a sweat at mid-day.</p>
<p>Pitjantjatjara is the native language of the local Aboriginal people who own the land, but most people speak English as well.</p>
<p>Cars can also be rented in Alice Springs. It is a 450-km drive to the resort from Alice, and should take between 4 and 5 hours. There are fuel stations along the Stuart Highway (A87) and the Lasseter Highway (A4). Be sure to top off your tank when you can. In addition, if you have an early flight from Alice Springs and plan to drive back in the morning, be sure to top off the day before, as fuel in Yulara is not open 24 hours - and they won't be open if you leave pre-dawn. Probably best to wait if you're not in a hurry.</p>
<p>Driving at night can be dangerous because of animals on the road, particularly kangaroos and cows (Lasseter Highway goes through cattle station land and is not fenced in all the way). Rental car agreements often prevent doing this drive outside daylight hours, mostly for your own safety.</p>
<p>A number of tour companies based in Alice Springs visit Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park. Note that the majority of the companies listed below are not based in Alice Springs but are re-sellers of the local operators. You may find it cheaper to visit Alice Springs and book a tour directly with a local operator. Tours range from basic 1-day bus tours (beware, this means at least 1,000 km of driving in 1 day) up to 5 days long, also often visiting Kings Canyon and the MacDonnell ranges on the way.</p>
<p>Tour companies also provide longer tours from many of Australia's capital cities including Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>The airport in Alice Springs is served by more destinations, but it is well over 5 hours drive from to Yulara. Unlimited mileage rental cars are not common in Alice Springs if you arrive and rent a car on the spot from the majors. Travel agents and the government tourist office do have access to unlimited mileage rates.</p>

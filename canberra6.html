The city of Goulburn, on the way to Canberra, is the training centre for New South Wales police officers who often send new recruits to run speed checks on the freeway. There are also several fixed speed traps, all of which are signposted in advance.</p>
<p>The drive from Melbourne to Canberra is 650Â km and takes roughly eight hours on the Hume and Barton Highways, again mostly on dual-carriageway roads. A great alternate driving route uses the Monaro Highway and travels through interesting terrain in the Snowy Mountains.</p>
<p>Public transport in Canberra is affordable and generally punctual, with most parts of the city accessible by tram or bus. The MyWay ticketing system covers the tram and bus services operated by Transport Canberra, however a separate ticketing system covers the cross-border bus services operated by CDC Canberra. Fares are paid by either tapping a credit card or debit card, a reusable MyWay+ smart card, or by scanning a QR code through the MyWay+ app. Information on ticket options is available here. Journey planning can be undertaken using Google Maps or Apple Maps. </p>
<p>A 12 kilometre light rail line (R1) operates between the city centre and the northern suburb of Gungahlin. Trams run at 15 minute intervals outside of peak periods, with frequency increasing to six minute intervals during peak periods. The advantage for tourists is that it connects the many hotels on Northbourne Avenue to Civic and Dickson and also provides access to events at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC). Note that Canberrans commonly refer to the light rail as the 'tram'.</p>
<p>Transport Canberra buses, commonly referred to by the former operator name ACTION, cover the majority of Canberra, with reduced services on weekends/public holidays. While Canberrans whinge about it, services are generally reliable and it has a useful range of routes for tourists. If you're staying in or near Civic and intend to only visit the main tourist sites, there's little need to rent a car.</p>
<p>Rapid bus services (R2 - R10) are the core of Canberra's bus network, and run directly between major transportation and commercial hubs. They run at as least 15-minute intervals between 7AM and 7PM on weekdays, with the exception of the R10, which only has this frequency during peak hours. These services tend to be direct, reliable, and utilise bus lanes for significant portions of their journeys.</p>
<p>Peak services (180-182) are limited express services between Civic and the suburbs of Tuggeranong. These services have a limited number of citybound departures in the morning peak, with services returning to the suburbs in the afternoon/evening peak.</p>
<p>Shuttle services (901-903) are specialised services that specific local precincts with unique demands, such as the health and education precinct surrounding the University of Canberra and North Canberra Hospital in Bruce, and the ACT's only correctional facility, the Alexander Maconochie Centre in Hume.</p>
<p>Local services (all routes with two digit numbers) make up the remainder of the network, running through Canberra's suburbs from one of the many interchanges throughout the city. As these services are often designed to connect a group of suburbs to their closest interchange, they generally take meandering and indirect routes through the suburbs, and will only run at half hourly intervals, even during peak periods.</p>

<p>The following chart outlines Darwin's monthly climate averages as an indicator for the whole northern region.</p>
<p>Jan - Feb</p>
<p>Mar - Apr</p>
<p>May - Sept</p>
<p>Oct - Dec</p>
<p>The Top End, which includes Darwin, Katherine, Kakadu National Park and Arnhem Land, has a tropical climate. Darwin has an average temperature of 32°C (90°F) all year, with varying humidity.</p>
<p>Darwin is climatically perfect to visit from May to October.  There is no need to check the weather forecast as it is nearly always 31°C (89°F) and sunny during the day, with cooler nights.</p>
<p>November and December is the time the build up, or pre-monsoon season, begins and humidity levels start to rise. The summer rains bring the natural landscape to life and deliver the picturesque storms and sunsets the Northern Territory is renowned for.   Some people enjoy this aspect of the wet, with the rivers and waterfalls in full glory, and the landscape greener. But its generally not a pleasant time to visit Darwin.</p>
<p>There is an airport shuttle bus, which meets all flights 24 hours, and taxis are available.</p>
<p>There are limited public transport services to the airport. Bus 3 has two deviations (c) and (d) which service Charles Eaton Drive and Henry Wrigley Drive. Bus 3(c) services run at three times M-F between 6:25 and 8:05AM, one at 12:30PM. Bus 3(d) services run at three times M-F between 3:55 and 5:20PM. If you are travelling outside these times, it is still possible to catch bus 3, get off just after stop C (Jingili shops) just before the bus turns down Scales St, and walk the 2 km down Henry Wrigley Drive to the Airport. Allow 30 min to walk there. Once you check in at the airport and go through security, there are free (hot) showers upstairs (turn right at the top of the escalators) to freshen up after your walk. Bus 3 is a circuit service starting and finishing at Casuarina Interchange (so you could also use this service to get from the airport to town). If you are travelling from the Darwin city centre, bus 10 operates from Darwin Interchange to Casuarina Interchange where you can then catch bus 3 to the airport. For detailed timetable information and fares, refer to the Darwin public transport website.</p>
<p>Darwin is easily accessible from all mainland state capitals, and Canberra, with Jetstar, Qantas and/or Virgin. Additional domestic services are provided by Nexus (Broome, Kununurra), and local airlines Airnorth and FlyTiwi. These last two airlines provide services to various isolated towns, islands and mines throughout the region. Airnorth additionally flies to larger destinations like Alice Springs, Broome, Cairns, Townsville, and seasonally to Perth. Alliance Airlines and Arafura Aviation offer limited charter services.</p>
<p>Three international flights exist: to Denpasar (Jetstar), Dili (Airnorth, Qantas), and Singapore (Singapore Airlines, and Qantas beginning December 2024). Singapore flights are timed to connect with flights to/from Europe.</p>
<p>The Stuart Highway is the only highway into Darwin; heading directly into the city centre and extending southwards all the way to Alice Springs (about 1,500 km) and Adelaide (3,042 km or 1,886 mi). You can access Darwin from all the Australian capital cities on regularly-trafficked sealed (bitumen) roads. The drive from Sydney or Perth is about 4000–4500 km  (2485 mi-2800 mi) depending on the route you choose, plan your trip and your stops carefully. Don't assume you can get fuel at night.</p>

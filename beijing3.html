Now, many of the hutongs have given way to broad boulevards and modern buildings, contributing to an airy, sprawling feel, in sharp contrast to cities like Hong Kong and Shanghai. Beijing is the political centre of the country, with official buildings and embassy areas dominating the city and many historical buildings and sites especially within the 2nd Ring Road.</p>
<p>Beijingers take great pride in being citizens of the capital, given the city's historical, cultural, and political significance. This pride is sometimes described as 大北京主义 or "Great Beijing-ism," reflecting their distinct attitude toward people from other regions of China. Compared to people elsewhere in the country, Beijingers are often more interested in politics and more willing to discuss current events. They also tend to be mindful of maintaining face and frequently use humor to navigate social situations. Despite this, many Chinese from other provinces find Beijingers to be friendly and straightforward, especially when compared to people from Shanghai. The city has undergone a remarkable transformation, evolving from a fast-growing, developing metropolis with occasional horse-drawn wagons on city streets in the 2000s, into an affluent, middle-class society marked by rampant consumerism and trendy hangout spots by the 2020s.</p>
<p>Beijing has a monsoon-influenced continental climate with hot, humid summers and cold, dry winters. The best time to visit is in September and October, during the "Golden Autumn" (金秋). Spring is the season for dust storms and is otherwise warm and dry. Summer can be oppressively hot and the tourist crowds tend to be the largest as well. Winter is cold and dry, with infrequent, but beautiful, snow. Temperatures can easily fall below −10 °C in winter and or just as readily rise above 35 °C in summer as well.</p>
<p>As of 2022, Beijing's permanent resident population stood at 21.84 million, with a registered population of 14.28 million. This difference is largely due to the difficulty many residents face in obtaining hukou, the household registration that grants access to better education and welfare services in the city. Beijing has been actively managing its population growth. The city has seen a continued decline in birth rates among its permanent residents in line with a wider national trend.</p>
<p>Explore books by foreigners who have experienced life in Beijing. This tradition started as early as the 13th century with the Travels of Marco Polo, where he gives an account of the layout of the city and its people during the time of Kublai Khan.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, two Peace Corps volunteers went on to write books about Beijing. The Last Days of Old Beijing: Life in the Vanishing Backstreets of a City Transformed by Michael Meyer (2008) offers an account of life in one of Beijing's remaining hutong neighborhoods, blending personal experiences with the city's modern architectural history. Peter Hessler, a writer for the New Yorker in Beijing during the 2000s, wrote Oracle Bones (2006), exploring the lives of ordinary people in China while documenting the country's transformation.</p>

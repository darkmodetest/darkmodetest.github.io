The road dead ends at Hualapai Hilltop, which is the trailhead for the town of Supai and its waterfalls (permit required in advance; it has reopened for 2023, but no new permits are available until 2024). There are no services along this route.</p>
<p>Many Grand Canyon visitors fly into one of two major metropolitan airports within half a day's drive of the South Rim:</p>
<p>There are no commercial bus lines offering transportation to either rim, but several tour companies offer guided tours originating in Flagstaff, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and other locations, either directly to the South Rim or that include the South Rim as part of an itinerary, and a few offer tours which include a visit to the North Rim. There is a small shuttle service, Groome Transportation, which does carry passengers and luggage from the Flagstaff Amtrak station. The tickets for this shuttle may also be purchased from Amtrak.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon Railway operates a train ride from the town of Williams to the Grand Canyon Village (travel time is 2½ hours in each direction).  The terminus at Grand Canyon Village is within walking distance of some accommodations.  The train features a historic steam locomotive during the summer season, restored Pullman cars, and a staged old west style shootout.  However, the Grand Canyon is not visible from the train.  It is simply another option for traveling to the canyon, and takes about twice as long as driving to the canyon.</p>
<p>Amtrak's Southwest Chief, with trains operating daily between Chicago and Los Angeles, stops at Williams Junction 3 miles (4.8 km) east of Williams town, with connections to the Grand Canyon Railway in Williams.  There is a Thruway bus shuttling passengers from Williams Junction to Williams town.</p>
<p>Entrance fees for Grand Canyon National Park are valid for seven days – you do not need a fee for the other Indigenous reservations.  Fees as of 2020 are:</p>
<p>There are several passes for groups traveling together in a private vehicle or individuals on foot/bike that provide free entry to Grand Canyon and all national parks, as well as some national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and national forests:</p>
<p>The National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks on five days every year:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Several viewpoints and trailheads in the park have limited or no parking and must be reached using the park shuttle system.  The National Park Service runs an extensive shuttle service on the South Rim with three interlocking routes. The service is free, and generally runs from before sunrise until after sunset, depending on the route.  Service is more frequent from May through September and includes additional routes.  In addition, during the summer the park service operates a shuttle from Tusayan into the park.</p>
<p>Horse and mule riders are required to follow a number of rules and restrictions while in the park, and must get a permit from the park service to keep animals in the park overnight.</p>

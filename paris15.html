Keep your sense of humour, and if necessary, write down phrases or place names. And remember to speak slowly and clearly. Unless you have an advanced level and can at least sort of understand French movies, you should also assume that it will be difficult for people to understand what you are saying (imagine someone speaking English to you in an indiscernible accent).</p>
<p>When in need of directions what you should do is this: find a younger person, or a person reading some book or magazine in English, who is obviously not in a hurry; say "hello" or "bonjour" (bon-zhor); start by asking if the person speaks English, "Parlez-vous anglais?" (Par-LAY voo on-glay?) even if the person can read something in English, speak slowly and clearly; write down place names if necessary. Smile a lot. Also, carry a map (preferably Paris par Arrondissement); given the complexity of Paris streets it is difficult to explain how to find any particular address in any language, no matter how well you speak it. If anything, the person may have an idea as to the place you are looking for, but may not know exactly where it may be, so the map always helps.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you will probably get the cold shoulder if you stop a random person in the métro, fail to greet them and say "where is place X or street Y".</p>
<p>Now, if you speak French, remember two magic phrases: "Excusez-moi de vous déranger" [ex-kuh-zay mwuh duh voo day-rawn-ZHAY] ("Sorry to bother you") and "Pourriez-vous m'aider?" [por-EE-AY voo may-DAY] ("Could you help me?") especially in shops; politeness will work wonders.</p>
<p>It is considered polite to always say "bonjour" (during the day) or "bonsoir" (at night) to employees when entering any type of shop even if you have no intention of buying anything. Upon leaving you should say "merci" to thank the shopkeeper for allowing you to browse and say "bonne journée" (bun zhur-nay) or "bonne soirée" (bun swa-ray) to wish them a good day or evening. "Bonne nuit" is only used when telling someone "goodnight" when going to bed.</p>
<p>Finally, if you speak a language other than English or French, and your French is limited or non-existent, offer to speak your second language with the phrase "Parlez-vous anglais ou XXXX?" (Par-LAY voo on-glay oo XXXX?) as this shows that you are making an effort to speak somebody else's language as well as your own.</p>

<p>The listings below are just some highlights of things that you really should see if you can during your visit to Paris. Detailed information can be found on each individual district page (click on the name of the sight).</p>
<p>All national museums and monuments are free for all every first Sunday of the month.</p>
<p>Planning your visits: several sites have "choke points" that restrict the number of visitors that can flow through. These include: The Eiffel Tower, Sainte-Chapelle, and the catacombs. To avoid lines, you should start your day by arriving at one of these sites at least 30 minutes before opening time. Otherwise, expect a wait of at least an hour. Most museums and galleries are closed on either Monday or Tuesday. Examples: the Louvre museum is closed on Tuesdays while the Orsay Museum is closed on Mondays. Be sure to check museum closing dates to avoid disappointment! Also, most ticket counters close 30-45 min before final closing.</p>

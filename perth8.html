Kangaroos are also commonly seen on many golf courses, including at The Vines and Joondalup Resorts.</p>
<p>There are also kangaroos that occasionally come close to the Mundaring Weir Hotel and the car park above Mundaring Weir/Lake C Y O'Connor.</p>
<p>Perth boasts some of Australia's best beaches along the coast, which are ideal for swimming during the warmer months. Sunscreen is essential, and insect repellent may come in handy during the evening. As the beaches are on the open ocean, it is strongly advised that you only 'swim between the flags' at patrolled beaches. Cottesloe Beach is one of Perth's most famous, and a favourite among locals and tourists alike, with its heritage pavilion. It's also the easiest to access via public transport from the nearby Cottesloe station on the Fremantle line, making it the quickest and easiest to get to from the CBD. Scarborough beach is also quite popular and accessible.</p>
<p>Perth is well known for its indie music scene at established venues such as Amplifier Bar, Rosemount, Fly By Night, The Rocket Room and Mojos. The Big Day Out Festival was held in early February every year. </p>
<p>Perth is home to several universities, of which the University of Western Australia is part of the prestigious "Group of Eight". All these universities have opportunities for international students to enrol in either as part of their degree programs, or as part of exchange agreements with foreign universities. Other universities located in the Perth metropolitan area are Curtin University, Murdoch University, Edith Cowan University and Notre Dame University.</p>
<p>The largest concentration of boutique shops is in the City centre while adjacent Northbridge is the place for niche independent stores. Trendier suburbs such as Mount Lawley, Leederville and Subiaco have a number of offbeat designer fashion stores.</p>
<p>Most of the top end luxury brands like Gucci, Chanel and Louis Vuitton are located on or around King Street in the CBD.</p>
<p>Large shopping complexes located in the outer suburbs, such as in Morley (Galleria), Cannington (Westfield Carousel), Midland (Midland Gate), Joondalup, Booragoon (Westfield Booragoon), Innaloo and Karrinyup have the usual department and chain stores.</p>
<p>Fremantle Markets offers an experience on its own with its over 150 independent stalls.</p>
<p>Shopping hours in the Perth metropolitan area for medium size shops to large supermarket/department stores are:</p>
<p>Even at the larger shopping centres, many smaller stores do not remain open until 21:00 each night except Thursday, which is the traditional, and still busiest, night for "late night shopping" in Perth. All shops are required to close for Good Friday, Christmas and ANZAC Day.</p>
<p>Small supermarkets such as IGA and other small shops can have more flexible shopping hours (some Petrol stations and small corner stores are open 24 hours).</p>
<p>A 10% Goods and Services Tax is included in listed prices. WaterTown (formerly Harbour Town) is where manufacturers have their factory outlets; some good deals can be found had there. It's walking distance from the centre of Perth, or catch the free Yellow CAT bus.</p>

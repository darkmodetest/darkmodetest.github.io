Even updated and restored hotels may exhibit wide variance in standards between room categories, and keep some of the rooms not refurbished or only minimally touched up to be able to offer attractive, eye-catching pricing for them and then upsell to more comfortable room categories. Always check out latest reviews, preferably with photos, to precisely determine what to expect from a given hotel and given room category.</p>
<p>Hotels outside of the city centre, or even outside of the Peripherique and Paris itself, can be far cheaper and better value for money than ones in central Paris, while still having good transit links via metro or RER. That said, you should check thoroughly how far from the metro / RER station the given hotel is, and whether the connection to the POIs you want to visit is direct, quick and easy. Do also factor in the added cost of transportation to outer zones, as well as the time spent to travel to and from the city and obviously resulting limitations.</p>
<p>Because of local preferences, a bathtub in the bathroom is a norm in most hotels, even if it means squeezing it into a very small bathroom, further limiting space. If you prefer a walk-in shower, you need to look for a hotel that specifically offers those (called "douche italienne" by the French), and you should generally look at newer, purpose-built properties.</p>
<p>Paris hotels, almost without regard to category or price, observe high and low seasons. These differ slightly from one hotel to another, but usually the high season roughly corresponds to late spring and summer, and possibly a couple of weeks around the Christmas season.</p>
<p>For individual hotel listings see the various Arrondissement pages. </p>
<p>For those staying for a week or more, renting a furnished apartment might be a more comfortable and money-saving option, especially for 3 or more adults. Furnished apartments can differ considerably in location and quality, offer different accommodations and selections of appliances and kitchen features, or may be well-above street level with no elevator. Expect apartment sizes to be modest. Access to local public transport can also vary widely. So choose carefully only after getting a full description of an interesting property.</p>
<p>Many websites will help you find rentals. Some do a more disciplined job of locating and describing properties and their locale. Most charge a commission of 10% or more; some offer insurance covering some risks. Some may offer a few apartments for shorter stays, usually at somewhat higher cost per day.</p>
<p>In late-spring and summer months, desirable properties may be in short supply. If your plans are fairly firm for those periods, you would be wise to "reserve" a unit well in-advance. Owners will often ask for a non-refundable deposit of up to 50% of the total cost of your stay. Means of payment can range from money order to PayPal or (occasionally) charge card. (Take great care of how and with whom you share any charge card account number.) You should send no payment to any post office box or similarly anonymous place or account...even after exchanging e-mails with a purported owner; most are no more than "blind" scams to take your money.</p>

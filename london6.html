<p>You may not have to buy a ticket from destinations within London's sphere of influence. Instead, you may be able to "touch in, touch out" using an Oyster or Contactless  payment card, on yellow-coloured readers at ticket gates or station entrances. Destinations within the Oyster and Contactless area include Amersham, Dartford, Gatwick Airport (), Heathrow Airport (), Hertford, Redhill and Watford (including Warner Bros Studio Tour London). Destinations within the Contactless area include St Albans, Hatfield, Reading, Slough and Welwyn Garden City.</p>
<p>Holidaymakers travelling between London and destinations further afield might be able to use a ranger or rover ticket. These include:</p>
<p>Travel direct into London St Pancras International (QQS IATA) from:</p>
<p>High-speed trains pass beneath the English Channel in a 31.5 mi (50.7 km) between Calais, Hauts-de-France and Folkestone, Kent.</p>
<p>Book in advance for the cheapest fares (at https://www.eurostar.com/). Passengers using an Interrail or Eurail ticket will need to book a seat at an additional cost.</p>
<p>You may be able to combine your Eurostar journey with connections from other cities in Europe. Find tickets with third-party websites such as Trainline (https://www.thetrainline.com/) and Deutsche Bahn (https://www.international-bahn.de/).</p>
<p>Passengers with standard or standard premier tickets should arrive around 90 min before their departure time (up to 120 min at Paris Nord or 60 min at Lille-Europe). You will need a passport for cross-channel travel, and will need to have your luggage checked at the station, before you get on the train. Gates close 30 min before departure.</p>
<p>Eurostar trains boast an on-board café serving sandwiches, hot food, and hot and cold drinks. There are also food and drink outlets in the departure lounges, in most cases both before and after passport checks.</p>
<p>London St Pancras International is close to Camden Town - famous for its markets, pubs and music scene - and Bloomsbury - which is home to the British Museum, several universities, and independent bookshops and cafés.</p>
<p>There are several major National Rail () stations in London. Clockwise from Paddington, these are:</p>
<p>Most international and domestic long distance coach (U.S. English: bus) services arrive at and depart from a complex of coach stations off Buckingham Palace Road in Westminster close to London Victoria rail station. Virtually all services operate from 51.49316-0.1486421 London Victoria Coach Station , which has separate arrival and departure buildings. Some services by smaller operators may use the 51.4929-0.146122 Green Line Coach Station  nearby. Listed below are the main coach operators. It is strongly recommended to book your travel in advance: fares can be much cheaper (even a day or two can make all the difference) and you avoid ticket office queues and potentially sold-out coaches. All large and many smaller coach operators allow passengers to show tickets on their mobile phone, and all will allow passengers to print tickets at home.</p>
<p>London is signposted on major routes in southern England, The Midlands and parts of Wales. Driving in London can prove expensive or - in heavy traffic - time consuming. You can park at railway stations further afield to catch the train into London if you would prefer not to drive.</p>

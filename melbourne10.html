The walking time between each end of the city is less than 30 minutes. A brisk walk may even see you keeping up with the trams as they crawl through the city centre.</p>
<p>Melbourne is a great city for arts, culture, dining, and events. Visitors frequently comment on the "good vibe" of the city, which can only be understood by experiencing it for yourself. There are a wide and varied assortment of attractions and sights, with something for every traveller. Most are in the CBD, in close reach of public transport. Melbourne is also a good base for experiencing the other attractions of Victoria, most of which can be reached on day trips.</p>
<p>Melbourne is Australia's best city for street art – refer to street art in Melbourne for more information.</p>
<p>It may be called "Australian rules" football, but the city that rules the game is Melbourne: until 1982, every team in what was then the Victorian Football League was based in Melbourne or Geelong, and even today 9 of 18 teams in the AFL hail from the city.  The season runs through winter from late March to late September, with big matches drawing up to 100,000 spectators.</p>
<p>For the first-time spectator, the "footy" looks like untrammeled mayhem, with the oval rugby-style ball carried, kicked, bounced or even punched — but never thrown — across the oval pitch while the opposing team's players tried to grab it or pummel its holder into submission.  The objective is simple enough: to kick the ball between the two tall goalposts (a goal, scoring 6 points), or barring that at least between a goal post and the shorter post next to it (a behind, scoring 1 point).  No protective equipment of any kind is used except for mouthguards, and almost anything goes when tackling, although traditionalists bemoan rule changes, such as banning moves like grabbing a player's arms from behind and ramming them into the ground head first!</p>
<p>All that said, footy fans are a surprisingly well-behaved lot and hooliganism is nearly unknown, with plenty of families and little old ladies attending matches. Fans of the two opposing teams usually sit together at games, and even though the cheering can get very passionate, actual crowd violence is almost unheard of, even at matches featuring rival teams. Tickets can be booked in advance from Ticketek, but for most games you can simply show up at the stadium before the match, with general admission tickets starting from $20.</p>
<p>Australian rules football, known to locals as just "football" or "footy", is the most popular sport in Melbourne, and mostly played in the winter. Melbourne is the spiritual home of the Australian Football League (AFL), with 9 of the league's 18 teams based on Melbourne. The teams play their home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) or the Docklands Stadium.</p>
<p>Cricket is the most popular summer sport, and the MCG ground hosts internationals between Australia and a handful of touring sides every year. The Boxing Day Test between Australia and whichever foreign team is touring Australia at that time commences 26th December every year, and usually runs for about 4-5 days. In domestic cricket, the MCG houses the Victoria state team in the Sheffield Shield (first-class) and One-Day Cup (one-day), as well as the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League (T20). Melbourne's other Big Bash team, the Melbourne Renegades, plays at the Docklands Stadium. Some international matches are held at the Docklands Stadium instead of the MCG, but the experience is regarded as far inferior to watching a game at the MCG.</p>

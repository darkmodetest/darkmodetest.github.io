For those staying in the valley, walking to get around is easy, scenic, and avoids the stresses of car travel in the valley.</p>
<p>The Valley also offers some of the most challenging and spectacular rock climbing in North America, with vertical faces 3,000 ft (910 m) and more feet tall. Wilderness permits are not required for nights spent on a wall, but it is illegal to camp at the base of any wall in Yosemite Valley. Additional regulations:</p>
<p>Commercial guided climbing trips are also available:</p>
<p>There are still commercial horseback-riding concessions in the Yosemite Valley, Wawona and Tuolumne Meadows areas.</p>
<p>Swimming is allowed in most bodies of water in the park, but is either prohibited or strongly discouraged near waterfalls due to the extreme danger of being swept away - to cite just one tragic example, as of 2010 the total number of people who have died after underestimating currents and being swept over Vernal Fall stands at seventeen. Other places where swimming is prohibited include the following:</p>
<p>Rafting is permitted on the Merced River between Stoneman Bridge (near Curry Village) and Sentinel Beach picnic area between 10AM and 6PM when the river stage (depth) is less than 6.5 ft (2.0 m) at Sentinel Bridge and the sum of air temperature and water temperature is greater than 100 °F (38 °C). All raft occupants must have a personal flotation device immediately available, and children under age 13 must be wearing one. Rafting is also allowed on the South Fork of the Merced River below Swinging Bridge (in Wawona).</p>
<p>Fishing is allowed in streams and rivers from the last Saturday in April through November 15, with the exception of Frog Creek near Lake Eleanor, where fishing season does not open until June 15 to protect spawning rainbow trout. Fishing is allowed in lakes and reservoirs year-round. A valid California fishing license is required for anyone aged 16 or older. Fishing supplies, including fishing licenses, are available at the Yosemite Village Sport Shop and at the general stores in Wawona and Tuolumne Meadows.</p>
<p>Special regulations that apply when fishing in the park include the following:</p>
<p>In March 2016 Yosemite changed its official concessionaire from DNC Parks & Resorts to Aramark. Unfortunately, when the 15-year, $2 billion contract was awarded the former concessionaire sued the park service for breach of contract, stating that Aramark had not been forced to buy trademarks and other intangible property related to concessions in Yosemite (which DNC owned and valued at $50 million). As a result, the park's new concessionaire did not have the right to use names like "Ahwahnee", "Wawona", "Curry Village" and "Badger Pass Ski Area" for the properties it now managed, so for three years visitors instead saw "The Majestic Yosemite Lodge", "The Big Trees Lodge", "Half Dome Village" and "Yosemite Ski & Snowboard Area" on their park maps.  Following several years of litigation a settlement was finally reached in July 2019, and the names of the park's iconic locations were returned to normal.</p>

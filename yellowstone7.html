There is a designated swimming area along the Firehole River near Madison Junction. Always stay on boardwalks in thermal areas. Scalding water lies under thin, breakable crusts; pools are near or above boiling temperatures. Every year visitors traveling off trail are seriously burned, and people have died from the scalding water. Park rangers can also issue $130 fines for being out of bounds, or much more if there is any geological damage. Serious violations can result in the visitor being banned from the park, or even facing criminal charges.</p>
<p>It's common to get sprayed with fine mist from the geysers, though. You don't need to worry about being burned, as the water has traveled a sufficient distance to cool down, provided you're within the designated areas. (Mist can't retain heat for more than half a second.)</p>
<p>Beware, glass lenses (such as eyeglasses and camera lenses) may be permanently damaged by the high mineral content of the water in the mist. For cameras, clear glass filters can provide inexpensive protection for high-priced lenses (be sure to have some replacements). If water from a thermal feature gets on a vulnerable lens, it must be washed off immediately. If no clean water is available, you can try – no, this is not a joke – licking the lens. If you try to wipe off the geyser water with a cleaning cloth (without rinsing the lens first), you risk grinding the suspended minerals into the glass of the lens, and scratching it. For eyeglasses, use safety goggles over glasses. These are quite cheap, and available at hardware stores.</p>
<p>This is one of the largest, high-altitude bodies of fresh water on the planet. The Lake is large enough to have its own weather effects, and conditions can change rapidly. More than a few fatalities have occurred on the lake, when boaters fell victim to weather conditions that went from calm and sunny to violent storm in a matter of minutes. East of West Thumb Geyser Basin, near Lake Village, there is a marina where boats are available for rental from a Park concessionaire.</p>
<p>Know your 10 essentials when going on a hike, cell phones (mobile phones) won't work in most areas of the park, and may not be depended on in an emergency situation.</p>
<p>The weather can change rapidly and with little warning. A sunny, warm day can quickly become a cold, rainy or even snowy experience even in summer. Hypothermia can be a concern. Be prepared for a variety of weather conditions by bringing along appropriate clothing. Lightning can and does injure and kill people in the park, so watch the sky and take shelter in a building if you hear thunder. If you don't like the weather, wait 10 minutes; it'll probably change.</p>
<p>When camping, either filter, boil, or otherwise purify drinking water.  Assume that even crystal clear waters may be polluted by animal and/or human wastes, and intestinal infections from drinking untreated water are increasingly common.  Iodine tablets are not as effective as other methods but are readily available at local stores and easy to bring on a hike.</p>

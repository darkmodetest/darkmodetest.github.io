The card can be obtained at subway stations in physical form or mobile version. When acquiring a physical card, a deposit of ¥20 is required. You can charge the card at subway stations, transit hubs, or service centers. It is worth noting that visitors with non-Chinese phone numbers have reported difficulties in getting the mini-app for the card to work within the Alipay payment app. </p>
<p>The card can be used mainly for:</p>
<p>The Great Wall of China (长城 Chángchéng) is the must-see on any trip to Beijing and a destination worth visiting multiple times due to its vastness and the variety of views, landscapes, and hikes it offers. The Wall is located about an hour by train or 1½ hours by bus from the city (be aware of bus scams, as mentioned in the "Stay Safe" section below). For general information on the Great Wall, see Great Wall, and for details on specific sections, refer to Northeastern Beijing, Yanqing District, Huairou District, and Northern Suburbs.</p>
<p>The Badaling section is the most famous but also heavily restored and crowded. For a more enjoyable tourist experience, Mutianyu is recommended over Badaling; it offers similar restoration but with fewer crowds. Closer to the city center, about 60 km away in Changping District, is Juyongguan Pass, a well-known section of the Great Wall located in a deep gorge of the Taihang Mountains north of Beijing.</p>
<p>For those seeking less crowded areas, Jinshanling and Huanghuacheng are more challenging to reach by public transportation but offer stunning views of the wall away from the crowds. The distant Simatai section in the northeast can be combined with a night visit or an overnight stay at Gubei Watertown, a recreated historical village beside the wall.</p>
<p>The heart of Beijing is defined by the Central Axis, a historic north-south line that runs through the city's core, showcasing its rich heritage and urban planning. Originating during the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) when Beijing, then known as Dadu, became the capital, the Central Axis was further developed in the Ming (1368–1644) and refined in the Qing Dynasty (1636–1912). The urban layout reflects the ideal capital city as prescribed in the ancient text Book of Diverse Crafts. In 2024, it was recognized as a  UNESCO World Heritage Site World Heritage Site under the title "Beijing Central Axis: A Building Ensemble Exhibiting the Ideal Order of the Chinese Capital."</p>
<p>At the northern end of the Central Axis in the Gulou neighborhood stand the iconic Drum and Bell Towers, remnants of the medieval city that served as timekeeping centers during the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.</p>
<p>Proceeding south along the axis, you reach the Forbidden City (故宫博物院), the most significant landmark along the Central Axis. This vast imperial palace complex served as the residence of emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasties and is a masterpiece of Chinese architecture. Remarkably, it remained largely untouched during the Cultural Revolution, thanks to Premier Zhou Enlai's intervention.</p>

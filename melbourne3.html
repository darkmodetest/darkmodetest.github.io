In March, Melbourne hosts one of the first races of the Formula One season, the Australian Grand Prix. The race is held in Albert Park in South Melbourne. Two professional Association Football teams are based in Melbourne, Melbourne Victory and Melbourne City FC; the two teams now share the new Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, commercially known as AAMI Park, and also play select matches at Marvel Stadium. The city also boasts one professional team in each rugby code, with both also playing at AAMI Park. The Melbourne Storm play rugby league in the National Rugby League, with teams throughout Australia plus one in New Zealand. The Melbourne Rebels play rugby union in Super Rugby, which features three other Australian sides, four in South Africa, five in New Zealand, and one each in Argentina and Japan. Melbourne is the unquestioned sporting capital of Australia with the largest arenas and two of the major sporting administrations basing their operation in Melbourne: Cricket Australia is a stone's throw from the MCG, and AFL games are played at the MCG and at Marvel Stadium.</p>
<p>The city's climate is notorious for its changeability, often referred to as "four seasons in a day". Its climate can be described generally as temperate, with warm summers and cool winters. During the summer of December to February, temperatures hover around 26–30 °C (79–86 °F), but it is not out of the ordinary for the city to swelter through heatwaves of over 40 °C (104 °F). Humidity is rarely an issue, with mildly comfortable nights down to about 16 °C (61 °F). With approximately 600 mm of rainfall annually, Melbourne gets only half as much rain as Sydney. October is typically the wettest month. Days are long, with sunrise at 6AM and sunset at 8:45PM.</p>
<p>Winter (June–August) is usually cool with a mix of clear, sunny weather and cold & damp conditions. Temperatures in winter can range from chilly overnight lows as low as 2 °C (36 °F) to daytime highs as high as 19 °C (66 °F) at times. Light snow has been recorded in and around Melbourne during the winter months only a couple of times over the last century, although the hills east of the city usually see a snow shower or two every winter. Daylight runs from 7:30AM to 5:15PM. You should consider visiting Melbourne in the autumn and spring — temperatures during these periods are usually very pleasant, without being unbearably warm with daytime highs usually in the 20s °C (70s °F).</p>
<p>With such unpredictable weather, it can be difficult deciding what to wear when planning a day out in Melbourne. A common tip is to wear layers of clothing, that can be removed or worn as the day goes on.</p>
<p>The city is primarily serviced by Melbourne Airport at Tullamarine which has international flights and a comprehensive domestic schedule. Avalon Airport is more distant, partway between Melbourne and Geelong, and hosts only a couple of domestic routes (Jetstar to Sydney & Gold Coast). Finally, five regional destinations can be reached on light aircraft from Essendon Airport: King Island and Flinders Island in Tasmania, and Dubbo, Orange and Wollongong in NSW. Essendon Airport is also the preferred airport for general aviation.</p>

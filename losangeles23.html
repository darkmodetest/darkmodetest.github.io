Gangs generally confine themselves to certain areas and should be of little concern to the typical traveler, who is unlikely to venture into such areas. Gangs will usually identify their territory with graffiti markings.  While most visitors to L.A. will not visit neighborhoods where gang violence is a concern, common-sense precautions apply should you become lost and end up in a bad neighborhood: remain on high-visibility roads or freeways, avoid confrontations with groups of young men, and should a confrontation arise flee immediately.  If a person who appears to be a gang member asks you where you are from, prepare to flee or to defend yourself, as that is a common gang challenge.  Use common sense on freeways to avoid incidents of road rage, which accounts for ten or so deaths per year.</p>
<p>Most homeless individuals are harmless; they will likely only ask you for money and if you refuse, will simply go on to the next person.  They are most heavily concentrated in Hollywood, Skid Row, and Venice Beach.  Avoid walking along Skid Row near Downtown at any time of day or night.</p>
<p>Since Covid, the perceived safety of the LA Metro has deteriorated sharply as it has become home to large numbers of homeless people, drug addicts and people with severe mental health issues who have been driven there from other public spaces in LA. This, in turn, has got it stuck in a vicious cycle where the perception of it being unsafe has further decreased ridership, which in turn makes the overall safety of the system even worse. While the vast majority of these people pose little danger to passengers, you are nonetheless very likely to see some extremely unsettling and unpredictable behaviour. Thus, in April 2024, the LA Metro board unanimously voted to declare a public safety emergency, and in June, a USC Dornsife survey found that 84% of Los Angeles residents believe the metro is unsafe.  Avoid all travel on the metro in the late evening and stick to busy periods if possible.</p>
<p>Minor earthquakes happen occasionally but they're almost always harmless. In the unlikely event of a major earthquake: If you're outside, try to find an open space clear of anything that might fall on you, such as trees, power lines, street lights or buildings. If you're inside, try to shield yourself under a table or desk from falling debris; your biggest threat comes from breaking windows and falling objects such as ceiling tiles and bookshelves, so try to reduce your exposure to these threats. If you can't find a table or similar protection, at the very least cover your head and neck with your arms. You are more likely to be injured if you try to run or stand during a quake, so drop to your hands and knees and crawl if you need to move. If you're driving, stop your car and move out of traffic, and stay in your car in a place clear of trees, power lines, street lights, and over- or underpasses. Since the 1950s, buildings have become progressively stronger with stricter building code regulations and research, and most buildings built after 1978 are in no danger of collapsing in the unlikely event of a major earthquake during your visit.</p>

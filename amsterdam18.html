The Cannabis Cup is organized by High Times magazine, and offers both tourists and natives the chance to enjoy 5 days of consuming and judging marijuana in different forms. Participants are eligible to pay $199 in advance or €250 at the door to obtain a "judges pass", which allows entry to the event for all five days, admission to numerous concerts and seminars held during the event, the ability to vote on numerous awards that are handed out, and free bus tours to and from the event. Day passes are available for €30 for each day, and certain concerts sell tickets at the door provided they are not already sold out.</p>
<p>The Red Light District consists of several canals, and the side streets between them, south of Centraal Station and east of Damrak. It is known as De Wallen (the quays) in Dutch, because the canals were once part of the city defences (walls and moats). Prostitution itself is limited to certain streets, mainly side streets and alleys, but the district is considered to include the canals, and some adjoining streets. The smell inside can be nauseating especially if you detest the smell of weed, cannabis or even tobacco - keep in mind especially if you're with a group, as it can be very difficult even with a mask on (pre-COVID, at least).</p>
<p>The area has many sex shops and peep show bars and is a common attraction for bachelors celebrating a stag night, both of which have become an eye-sore for most locals; if you ever get hassled, a firm and loud "leave me alone" will work most of the time. The whole area has a heavy police presence and many security cameras. Nevertheless, it is still a residential district and has many bars and restaurants, and also includes historic buildings and museums.</p>
<p>Amsterdam has over 400 registered hotels of varying standards from budget facilities to some of the most expensive hotels in Europe. Advance booking is recommended, especially for weekends and holidays. Don't expect you'll find an affordable bed once you're here. Most hotels and hostels can be found in the Binnenstad, notably south of Centraal Station, and in Zuid around the Museum Quarter. Charming boutique accommodation can be found in the wealthy residential Canal District, home to the rich and famous and its squares are the prime nightlife spots of the city. The Jordaan is another area for hip boutique accommodations, slightly upmarket, but still for mid-range prices. Some cheaper hostels can also be found in the Red Light District.</p>
<p>A simple bed in a hostel starts around €18 on weekdays in the winter and up to €90 on a weekend in the summer. Hostels often expect you to book at least 2 nights in a weekend. A twin room in a budget hotel, 1-2 stars, might cost around €40 on weekdays in the winter and up to €100 on summer weekends. In a three and four-star hotel, the prices would range from €100 to €200, depending on season, and five-star hotels can cost between €150 and €400 a night. As a rule of thumb, summer is high season and price can be double compared to winter times. September and October tend to be cheaper months to travel.</p>

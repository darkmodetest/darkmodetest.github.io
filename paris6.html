Companies like Air Charter Advisors and Priority Jet offer access to a variety of aircraft rentals based at Le Bourget.</p>
<p>Paris is well connected to the rest of Europe by train. There are seven terminus stations in central Paris and although they are not all in the same district, they are all connected to the Metro and RER networks. You will probably want to know in advance at which station your train is arriving, so as to better choose a hotel and plan for transport within the city.</p>
<p>The SNCF (French national railway authority) operates practically all trains within France excluding the Eurostar to London, the Thalys to Brussels and onward to the Netherlands and Germany[dead link], and some low-cost services such as Ouigo (although owned by the SNCF, it is considered as a separate brand). There are also a few local lines of high interest to tourists which are privately owned. All SNCF, Eurostar and Thalys tickets can be bought in railway stations, city offices and travel agencies (no surcharge). SNCF relies on travel agencies for selling tickets online, the main one being SNCF Connect and Trainline (easier to use). You can also find tickets in online and physical travel agencies. You can book and buy tickets up to three months in advance. There are significant discounts if you book weeks ahead. Reduced ticket prices are different for each day and each train and can be used only on the train the reservation is for. Trains between Paris and south Germany (Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich) as well as the Marseille-Frankfurt TGV are jointly operated by SNCF and Deutsche Bahn, but each of the two operators will sell tickets at its own price! Make sure to check the price offered by each operator before you buy, or use Trainline since they automatically compare SNCF and DB prices.</p>
<p>There are a number of different kinds of high-speed and normal trains:</p>
<p>For most train stations, take the  14  to Gare de Lyon and follow the directions given from Gare de Lyon.</p>
<p>While domestic bus lines were tightly regulated until 2015, they no longer are, and this has led to a heavily competitive and fast growing market. Companies that serve Paris are:</p>
<p>Several autoroutes (expressway, motorway) link Paris with the rest of France:  and  to the north,  and  to the south,  to the east and  and  to the west. Not surprisingly, traffic jams are significantly worse during French school holidays.</p>
<p>The multi-lane highway around Paris, called the Périphérique (BP), is probably preferable to driving through the center. Another beltway nearing completion; L'A86 (also  and A286) loops around Paris about 10 km further out from the Périphérique. A third, incomplete beltway is much further out and called La Francilienne (N104).</p>
<p>It is advised not to drive within Paris and to be wary in the metropolitan area. It is better to drive to a suburban train station with a parking lot and then use the train to continue your trip throughout Paris. Most of Paris' roads were created long before the invention of automobiles. Traffic inside the city tends to be heavy, especially at rush hour; driving, however, may be rather easy and efficient in the evening. Parking is also difficult. Furthermore, the medieval nature of parts of the city's street system makes it very confusing, and traffic will almost never allow one to stop or slow down to get one's bearings. If you are unfamiliar with the streets and still insist on driving in the city, make sure you have a navigator in the passenger seat with you. However, Paris does have several iconic boulevards that have multiple lanes, form the backbone of the city’s road network, and are useful if you do choose to bring a car — and are tourist attractions onto themselves.</p>

<p>ACT Cabs is the local taxi service. Customers can book a taxi by calling the 24 hours taxi booking number ☏ +61 2 6280 0077, book using the ACT Cabs mobile App, or book a taxi online. Ride share services are provided by Uber, Didi and HOP.</p>
<p>Drivers are often confused by the many signs around Canberra that direct you to the "Town Centre".  The unanswered question that the sign poses, is "Which Town?".   The city centre, also known as "Civic", is its own centre, but the other Canberra "towns" are Belconnen and Gungahlin (to the north of the lake), and Woden, Weston Creek, Molonglo and Tuggeranong (to the south). Each of these towns has its own suburbs.  You will see signs directing you to each of these towns, but once you get closer the sign will simply direct you to the "town centre".  You need to know which town you are in for the sign to make sense.</p>
<p>Canberra roads are generally of excellent quality. National rental companies operate kiosks from Canberra Airport. Alternatively, all major operators have locations in the civic for easy access to vehicle hires. </p>
<p>Few of the major attractions provide free parking. During working hours high demand, from both visitors and employees, can see parking spaces very limited in the Parliamentary Triangle (which contains the National Library, Questacon, Old Parliament House, National Gallery, Commonwealth Place etc.).</p>
<p>Parking meters accept credit cards or cash. Parking in the town centres is difficult on weekdays. It is also difficult to park at night in Civic. There are several multi-level carparks near the Canberra Centre with ticket pay-stations and pay-booths. All day parking in the Canberra Centre is cheaper on the rooftop level.  You will need to collect a parking entry ticket from the first boom gate and then feed the ticket into the second boom gate as you enter the rooftop level.</p>
<p>The default speed limit on all roads in the ACT is 50 km/h, unless signposted otherwise. In urban areas, major roads in the ACT have speed limits between 60 and 90 km/h, while freeway-grade roads in Canberra and most rural-ACT roads have a speed limit of 100 km/h. Occasionally, the same road has a different speed limit for traffic heading in opposite directions. The ACT also has the highest number of speed cameras per capita in Australia. Fixed speed cameras have warning signs in advance via overt signage; red light/speed cameras have much smaller warning signs, usually not coupled with a sign reminding of the speed limit. Mobile speed camera vans operate in the ACT (typically, but not always, on major roads); these may be overtly or covertly parked, and are identified by a large white sign on the roof. 40 km/h school zones are active throughout the school day (unlike surrounding New South Wales where they only operate for an hour or two at the beginning and end of the school day). School zones are rigorously policed.</p>
<p>There are few fuel stations on the main roads; instead they tend to be located near local shops, off the main roads. Look for the small blue fuel pump signs pointing off the main roads. Start looking well before you run too low. There are several service stations just east of Northbourne Avenue at Civic. Petrol is also usually more expensive in Canberra than Sydney.</p>

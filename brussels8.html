Since Brussels is a fairly small city, in practice, you can get anywhere in under an hour so the time limit will rarely be an issue.</p>
<p>You can board any metro, tram or bus by tapping a contactless credit/debit card, including through Apple Pay/Google Pay. You are charged €2.20 per journey, capped at a maximum of €8 per day. See STIB-MIVB for details.</p>
<p>Tickets are also available via the MoBIB smart card. Should you stay longer than a few days in Belgium, it may be worth investing in a MoBIB card. The card costs €5, is available for purchase at major metro stations and the 3 axis  NMBS railway stations (Brussels-North, Central, and South), and can also be used in other Belgian cities. The card can then be loaded with fares at GO vending machines in all metro stations and at many tram and bus stops. A MoBIB card is required to purchase 5 journey tickets (€8), 10 journey tickets (€14), 2 day passes (€14) or 3 day passes (€18).</p>
<p>Alternatively, paper tickets can also be purchased from GO vending machines and are available for a single journey (€2.10) or a day pass with unlimited journeys (€7.50). Since 2020, it is no longer possible to purchase tickets directly from drivers, so do purchase your tickets in advance at a GO machine. Blue GO machines only accept debit and credit cards, and coins, but no paper currency. Red GO machines accept cash up to € 40. The interface is available in English, Dutch, French and German.</p>
<p>To validate either a MoBIB card or paper ticket, touch it against the red card readers until it beeps, and the screen lights up green. You must validate your ticket on the first vehicle you enter and at each transfer afterwards. On buses and trams, the card readers are in the vehicles, whereas metro and underground tram stations have card readers with electronic gates at their entrances. If the card reader lights up red, it means there is no valid ticket on your card, possibly because the 1-hour time window has expired. At some stations you need to validate again to leave. Groups of travelers can share a single MoBIB card if it has multiple tickets available, like 5- or 10-journey tickets. If you're with a group of 3, for example, simply touch the MoBIB card against the card reader 3 times to validate 3 journeys at once. At each transfer, you must again validate it 3 times. Groups must stay together during travel, since ticket checks are carried out routinely, and you must be able to present a validated ticket at any time. Failure to do so will result in a fine of €100.</p>
<p>Since buses and trams tend to get stuck in traffic, metro and underground tram lines are the fastest form of public transport. Most attractions can be reached by metro and a short walk. Metro entrances are marked by big  signs with the station name underneath. All announcements are made in Dutch, French and English. There are 4 metro lines,  1   and  5   running roughly east-west, and connecting the inner city with the European Quarter, Woluwe, and at the end of line  1  , Kraainem. Metro line  6   connects the inner city to the Heizel, and is the most convenient way to reach the Atomium. Ring line  2   shares its trajectory with line  6   until the Simonis station, and can be taken in both directions with a possible transfer at Simonis being necessary to complete your journey.</p>

While most people don't spend any time outside of the city there is plenty to do in Country ACT if you want to get away from the museums and attractions for a while.</p>
<p>Country ACT is also home to Namadgi National Park, making up about 47% of the entire ACT and the most northerly of the Australian Alps national parks. There are lots of walking tracks, including scenic views over the Brindabella Ranges, mountain bike trails and scenic drives (on unsealed roads), and rock climbing at Booroomba Rocks.  Enquire at the visitors centre on Naas Road or see the website for further details. In winter roads in the park may be closed because of snowfall. The park is a good place for those who'd like a bit of snow.</p>
<p>There are several historic homesteads in Country ACT of early Canberra settlers, and some of them have guided tours and walks, cafes for lunch, coffee and cake. Popular ones include Lanyon Homestead, Calthorpe's House and Mugga Mugga house in Symanston. For other settlements reflecting "ACT before Canberra", there's Tharwa, a small village, one of the original settlements in the ACT area. See the old bridge over the Murrumbidgee River, visit Lanyon Homestead (see below) and Cuppacumbalong Pottery. Tharwa is also the gateway to Namadgi National Park and Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve.</p>
<p>For space buffs, Canberra's vast open green spaces outside the highly urbanised territory makes it an ideal location to view the stars and conduct research. Historically, inside Namadgi National Park are Honeysuckle Creek and Orroral Valley, the former sites of tracking sites for the Apollo Moon Landings. Today, there are only remnants of what used to be there, but if you're both a history and space buff, it's worth checking it out.</p>
<p>Another astrotourism site, the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex, is part of a network of three NASA facilities worldwide used to maintain contacts with probes launched from Earth. The facility is visually impressive, and claims to have "the largest antenna complex in the southern hemisphere". It also has an interesting visitors centre. The complex is only about a 45 minute drive from Civic.</p>
<p>If you're looking to see the stars and planets, there's one major observatory in Canberra â€“ Mount Stromlo Observatory in Country ACT just west of Weston Creek. It is Australia's premier astronomical observatory and while it was badly damaged in the 2003 bushfires, the partially rebuilt observatory reopened in October 2004. They run a Saturday night star gazing event for the public, but it's more spectacular when you visit the observatory during an important astronomical event.</p>
<p>If you're still into space, but don't have a car to get around Canberra, getting to the above sites is difficult, but the CSIRO Discovery Centre in Acton just north of the Australian National Botanic Gardens has some space exhibits and a bit about its many space and astronomy research projects. If you're not aware of who CSIRO is, it is Australia's leading science and technology agency, making this a true space exhibit, and not just "any other space exhibit".</p>

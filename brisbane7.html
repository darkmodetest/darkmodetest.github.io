If your street map shows a tangle of winding streets close together that is a sign of steep roads. A short trip can quickly become a lot of work; stick to the river when possible, it's where you get the best views and it is almost entirely flat.</p>
<p>If you leave the cycle paths, footpaths, and minor streets you should be prepared to contend with busy urban traffic. Feel free to ignore any Brisbane motorists that may have resentment toward cyclists and ignorance of the road rules applying to cyclists; cyclists are permitted to travel on just about all roads in Brisbane. Special "bicycle lanes" on Brisbane's roads are becoming increasingly common and are often denoted by a narrow green-coloured strip of road adjacent to the curb.</p>
<p>Brisbane is an excellent city for walking and you should have no problems getting around the CBD. Within minutes of walking in virtually any direction you will be able to find a bus, train or ferry station. Maps can be purchased from bookstores, any tourist information centre or viewed online. There are also a number of shared pathways that offer relaxed walking routes away from roads and traffic. Beyond the CBD and inner-suburbs however, sights can become very spread out, so you might want to consider other modes of getting around. Areas near the river are relatively flat and are perfect for walking. If you find yourself lost, it's advisable to head to the nearest main road as more than likely it will be serviced by buses or trains.</p>
<p>Brisbane's Fortitude Valley has the highest concentration of bars, pubs and clubs anywhere in Australia and in 2005, was given Australia's first and only "Special Entertainment Precinct" zoning, which protects and promotes the live music scene. In 2007, influential US entertainment Billboard magazine named Brisbane in the world's top 5 hotspots for live music. And in 2010 the city opened the Go-Between Bridge, named after the popular Brisbane indie rock band The Go-Betweens. There is no doubt that the locals love their music and a night out in Brisbane is not complete without experiencing some of the live music on offer. If you are looking for what's happening in Brisbane, most music and entertainment stores as well as some restaurants and cafés offer free entertainment magazines that list what's coming up within the next month or so. Brisbane and the surrounding South East Queensland region plays host to a myriad of music and arts festivals and are advertised in these magazines.</p>
<p>Though you might find most musicians playing in the numerous bars and clubs around the CBD, West End and the Valley, there are some venues which are geared specifically toward hosting bands or artists that are on official tours. Some events allows under-18s in, but not all, so it's best to check beforehand.</p>
<p>The Valley Fiesta[dead link] is an annual three-day event. It was launched by Brisbane Marketing to promote Fortitude Valley as a hub for arts and youth culture. It features free live music, market stalls, food and drink from many local restaurants and cafés, and other entertainment.</p>

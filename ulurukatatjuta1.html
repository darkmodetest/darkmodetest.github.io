<p>Uluṟu-Kata Tjuṯa National Park is a park in the Northern Territory of Australia, part of the so-called Red Centre of the continent. The national park is a UNESCO World Heritage area and is best known for Uluṟu (also known as Ayers Rock), a single massive rock formation, and also for Kata Tjuṯa (also known as "The Olgas"), a range of rock domes.</p>
<p>Yulara is the only service village nearby, built to offer supplies and accommodation for visitors to the park.</p>
<p>Visitors should understand that there are three locations that they need to be familiar with when visiting.  Firstly, the airport – that is known as Ayers Rock airport. Secondly, the national park – that contains both the Rock (Uluṟu) and Kata Tjuṯa (The Olgas). The park closes at night, and has few services and no accommodation or camping. Thirdly, Yulara that is the resort town that contains all the services for the area. The three locations are all distinct, and you need to consider how you will travel between them.</p>
<p>Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa are considered sacred places by the local Aboriginal people. The land is owned by the indigenous Anangu people, leased by the government and jointly managed by the Anangu and the Australian parks and management services. Visitors will notice efforts throughout the area to include and encourage respect for the Anangu perspective on the land.</p>
<p>Much of Kata Tjuṯa is off-limits, and climbing Uluṟu is also illegal. A few areas around the base of Uluru are also off-limits for photography, although there is no problem with it throughout most of the park. In practice, however, the daily management of the parks is handled by members of the Australian parks department.</p>
<p>The Anangu people have connected to the area for thousands of years. Some records suggest they may have been there for more than 10,000 years. On an expedition in 1872, the explorer Ernest Giles saw the rock formation from a considerable distance, although he did not reach the base. Giles described it as "the remarkable pebble". In 1873, the surveyor William Gosse followed his footsteps and reached the rock. He chose to name it in honour of the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. Giles himself chose to name the domes nearby for Olga, the Queen of Württemberg.</p>
<p>The names Uluṟu and Kata Tjuṯa come from the local Pitjantjatjara language and respectively mean "Earth Mother" and "Many Heads". In the Pitjantjatjara language they are written as Uluru and Kata Tjuta, the letters with macrons indicating that they are pronounced with the tongue curled upwards and touching the upper part of the palate instead of the front part or the teeth.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Australian government moved to a dual-naming policy – initially "Ayers Rock / Uluru", and then "Uluru / Ayers Rock". "Uluru" is now the common-usage name amongst all but the elderly. Official material tends to begin with the dual-named "Uluru / Ayers Rock" and later use simply "Uluru".</p>
<p>Uluṟu is one of Australia's best known natural features, the long domed rock having achieved iconic status as one of the symbols of the continent. The rock is a so-called monolith, i.e. a single piece of rock or a giant boulder, extending about 5 km beneath the desert plain and measuring 3.6 by 2.4 km at the surface. It rises 348 metres above the plain (862.5 metres above sea level) and has a circumference of 9.4 km. Some say that Uluru is the biggest of its kind, others say that Mount Augustus in Western Australia is bigger. Whatever the case may be, standing in front of Uluru and seeing its massive bulk rise above the flat plain surrounding it, it is nothing less than impressive. The rock undergoes dramatic colour changes with its normally terracotta hue gradually changing to blue or violet at sunset to flaming red in the mornings as the sunrises behind it.</p>

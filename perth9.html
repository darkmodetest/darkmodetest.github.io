Nearly all stores are open on Boxing Day, but some are not. Boxing Day sales attract massive crowds, so be prepared for long lines. Department stores like Myer and David Jones can be extremely busy on sale days, and shopping centre car parks reach capacity almost as soon as the doors open. Some retailers have started offering Black Friday deals in November, but this hasn't fully caught on yet.</p>
<p>One of Perth's drawbacks is that its people have not embraced late night dining. Very few places will serve food after 10PM, even on Friday or Saturday nights. Most restaurants in Perth do not cater for vegetarians or vegans, and if they do - the range is extremely limited. If you are looking for a place that embraces vegetarian food, Fremantle is great.</p>
<p>There is an extensive array of restaurants in Northbridge. You will find a great selection of Southern European and Asian restaurants. Northbridge gets very busy on Friday and Saturday nights as Perth goes into party mode. Neighbouring Mount Lawley and Highgate also have some good options. Victoria Park has a stretch of restaurants along Albany Hwy which is a fairly steady location with the locals and has a few high quality restaurants, although is lower key and more casual. Northbridge is also home to Perth's Chinatown. As most ethnic Chinese residents of Perth are descended from Malaysian Chinese immigrants, much of the Chinese food is based on Malaysian Chinese food.</p>
<p>Fremantle is a good eating option. Famous for its cappuccino strip lined with cafes next door to one another popular with the yuppie crowd. On weekends, a local tradition is to visit the Fisherman's Wharf on warm, sunny weekend evenings for fish and chips. There are a couple of options to choose from close to the beach. Just follow your nose or the seagulls. Further exploring in Fremantle, or "Freo" as it is locally known, can reveal lots of trendy, alternative restaurants that cater for the "careful" eaters. If you care about knowing what it is you are eating, (vegan, preservative free, fair trade, organic), try exploring the Freo markets area, or ask around, they are often not in the "touristy areas".  Little Creatures is a decent brewery, but is also a yuppie pub.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a decent fish and chip or seafood dinner, it is typically far more expensive by the coast (where the tourists are), excellent seafood at a better price can be sourced in the central and eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>Subiaco is located a couple of kilometres from the city centre. It is a trendy but fun suburb which features some great food and entertainment, although it can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>Claremont is a suburb on the Fremantle railway line where you will find some good restaurants as well (including authentic Italian), although, again, it can be quite expensive and there is a limited range.</p>
<p>The Swan Valley, especially along West Swan Road contains various wineries, food producers and restaurants with stunning views over the vineyards.  Particularly good are The Black Swan Cafe, Duckstein Brewery, Elmar's and The Mallard Duck Cafe.</p>

In reality, they will wait until your money is in the machine, then lean across, cancel the transaction and pocket your cash. Say "No thanks" politely - you know what ticket you want to buy!</p>
<p>Selling/asking for a donation for "lucky heather": This scam, usually operated by women, involves someone handing you "lucky heather" (a small flower usually wrapped in foil) and then either trying to sell it to you or asking for a monetary donation. They will come up with a vague charity ("money for sick children", "money for orphaned babies", and so on) and show you a purse full of supposed "donations". If you are handed one of these flowers either hand it back or drop it on the ground and leave. Be aware that you if you take the flower and leave without "donating" you could be chased and harassed by the people involved in the scam.</p>
<p>Pedicabs: A common sight in central London is a brightly lit rickshaw blaring loud music and offering rides. You should not use them as they are presently unregulated and often seriously overcharge their passengers.</p>
<p>As of November 2024, anyone displaying Jewish or Israeli symbols may face harassment or even assault in London, and police may blame you for "provocation" just for wearing such symbols, rather than protecting you.</p>
<p>Although not illegal, London is a known hotspot for charity collectors, some of whom can be extremely persuasive in trying to obtain a donation; therefore they have earned the name "charity muggers" or "chuggers". If you do not want to donate, be polite but forceful, and under no circumstances provide any form of bank details. Larger charities ask their collectors to have specific and verifiable identification.</p>
<p>Don't take illegal minicabs (see Get around for details). No Minicabs are allowed to ply for trade on the street, and any doing this should be avoided.</p>
<p>Travelling on the lower deck of a night bus is generally safer, as there are more passengers around, and you are visible to the bus driver.</p>
<p>If you've lost an item on the Underground, Overground or Docklands Light Railway, in a licensed black cab, or on a red London bus then you should contact the TfL Lost Property Office as soon as possible. If an item is lost or misplaced on other transport services in London, the relevant service operator should be contacted.</p>
<p>Bank, credit and debit cards, when found, are securely destroyed. Contact your bank immediately if you lose these on a transport service.</p>
<p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) will provide emergency treatment for anyone in the UK, irrespective of whether they reside in the UK, but if you are not a UK resident you will be expected to make a contribution (up to the entire cost) towards such treatment. Travel insurance is essential.</p>

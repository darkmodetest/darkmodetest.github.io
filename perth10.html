Perth locals used to go for picnics and produce festivals in these areas back in the 19th and early 20th century; however as the practice waned with fashions leading towards the coast, it is an excellent place to visit away from the touristy areas for a relaxing or peaceful trip to the bush with fine views and decent food not too far from the city. People often do DIY food tours to local orchards, vineyards, cheesemakers, bakeries and other cottage industries, arts and cafes as its not really organised. Its usually best to visit during Spring or soon after the rains when the forest is at its best.</p>
<p>Guildford has many antique stores (although like all Australian antique markets it is visited by many hundreds of tourists and locals, so real bargains can be rare), but you can get decent cafe morning teas and lunches in some fine old architecture. This area has some of Perths oldest residential houses and grand building museums & cafes. The old theatre now houses a large Asian textile and artworks store worth a visit and a quirky taxidermy museum a few doors down. Alfreds Kitchen is a tiny but legendary burger bar to the locals, who amass in large crowds that opens at night.</p>
<p>Delis can be found scattered throughout the suburbs. These small stores, sometimes located in a converted houses, sell basic household supplies, magazines, and food cooked fresh to order. Menus mostly revolve around fish and chips. Servings are cheap, but can be larger than expected. Cooking times are often different than store hours, so check before hand.</p>
<p>A large Western Rock Lobster (known locally by its former name of crayfish) industry. Most of the crayfish is exported to Asia for vast sums of money. However, crayfish prices in Perth can be relatively cheap, especially during summer in a good season. A chance to give it a try without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Chilli Mussels are a popular local specialty, consisting of mussels cooked in tomato and chilli jus, available in various restaurants.</p>
<p>Truffles are grown around Mundaring and Manjimup, and hosts an individual truffle festivals at different times in the year.</p>
<p>The nearest wine region to Perth is the Swan Valley which has many wineries, distilleries and breweries. In addition to cellars where you can sample the wines many wineries also have restaurants or caf√©s for meals. The second most recognized region is the Margaret River region (about a three-hour drive away) which is extremely popular for wine tasting, delicious chocolate and fresh, locally made food and produce. Lesser publicized regions include the Porongurup region which is recognised internationally for its Rieslings, Mount Barker region also produces fine Rieslings and Shiraz.</p>
<p>Perth has an abundance of Gloria Jeans, Miss Mauds and Dome stores mainly in the city centre and suburban shopping areas. Clusters of independent European style cafes line the trendy streets of suburbs around the city centre. The most well known place for a decent espresso is the Cafe Strip in Fremantle closely followed by the districts of Subiaco, Leederville and South Perth. Perth culture has a high quality taste for coffee and demands very high standards in product.</p>

If your travel plans change after you have added money to your myki, you can get a refund at the PTV hub at Southern Cross Station. You have the option of registering your myki, which involves creating an account and linking your myki to it. Lost or stolen mykis can only be reimbursed if they are registered.</p>
<p>Laws surrounding public transport are strict. Ticket inspectors patrol the network, and issue fines of up to $413 on the spot for offences such as fare evasion, putting feet on seats, swearing, drinking alcohol, blocking doors, and being in unauthorised areas.</p>
<p>It should be noted that infringement notices are not given out by ticket inspectors, although they do have the power to arrest you until police arrive. Rather, they take your details and report you to the Victorian Department of Transport, who will subsequently send an infringement notice or a formal warning to your address. Fines will not be pursued if your address is outside Australia.</p>
<p>The train network is operated by Metro Trains Melbourne with blue branding. A partly-underground "City Loop" forms the basis of the network, with all the other lines branching off to the suburbs like the spokes of a wheel. The lines are named after the terminating station at the end of the line, and all originate from Flinders Street Station, the city's famous suburban railway hub. Trains to the suburbs generally operate at 10-20 minute frequencies, with higher frequencies (but more overcrowding) in peak times. Be aware that express trains skip some of the smaller suburban stations; check information screens carefully to be sure.</p>

Trams are a prominent feature in Melbourne's urban landscape and a tourist attraction in themselves. The city has the largest network in the world. The network is operated by Yarra Trams with green branding. Most tram lines cross the city in each direction, and branch out from the city centre like spokes. In the city, they often become crowded, and you are unlikely to get a seat. The network is operated by a mix of newer, low-floor trams with stop announcements and older models with step-entry. Stops in the inner city generally have platforms, although most stops require hailing the tram from the side of the road; take care at these stops and look for distracted cars which may illegally speed past. Most tram stops on Swanston Street (in city centre) are located on bike lanes. Please be careful not to walk onto the bike lane until the trams stops in front of you.</p>
<p>The free City Circle Tram (Route 35) runs around the CBD perimeter, operated by vintage-style maroon or green trams. These trams are geared to visitors and provide access and audio commentary regarding sites of interest to the tourist. More information is provided in the City Centre guide.</p>
<p>Yarra Trams' official iOS and Android app, tramTRACKER, is very useful for tracking real-time tram arrivals and following the tram's progress on board. Most tram routes will have 8-12 minute service during the day, with higher frequencies in the peak, but lower frequencies of 20â€“30 minutes in the evenings.</p>

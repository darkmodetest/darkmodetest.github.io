<p>Acadia National Park is along the rugged, rocky coast of "Downeast" Maine. Most of the park is on Mount Desert Island, which is accessible by vehicle. The park is approximately six hours north of Boston.</p>
<p>From Boston take I-95 north to Augusta, Maine, then Route 3 east to Ellsworth and on to Mount Desert Island. 
For an alternate route, continue on I-95 north to Bangor, Maine, then take Route 1A east to Ellsworth. In Ellsworth, take Route 3 to Mount Desert Island. By car to the Schoodic section of Acadia National Park in Winter Harbor: Follow Rt. 1 North/East from Ellsworth to Rt. 186.</p>
<p>Direct flights from Boston's Logan Airport land at the Hancock County Airport, 10 mi (16 km) from Acadia National Park. National airlines serve the Bangor International Airport, about one hour from the park. Car rentals are available at both airports.</p>
<p>There is no longer ferry service from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth Nova Scotia. "The Cat" is no longer in service.</p>
<p>Entrance fees as of 2020 are:</p>
<p>There are several passes for groups traveling together in a private vehicle or individuals on foot/bike that provide free entry to Acadia National Park and all national parks, as well as some national monuments, national wildlife refuges, and national forests:</p>
<p>The National Park Service offers free admission to all national parks on five days every year:</p>
<p>The free Island Explorer bus system, Phone: +1 207-667-5796, can take you through the park, stopping at points of interest.  There are bicycle racks on the front and back of each bus if you'd like to combine transport methods as you explore. Island Explorer buses are propane-powered.</p>
<p>There is an extensive network of carriage roads throughout Acadia National Park, which are closed to automobiles and are excellent places to ride your bicycle.  The carriage roads are mostly paved with crushed stone and, therefore, are best navigated on a mountain or hybrid bicycle.  Another option for cyclists is the ~20 mile (32 km) long Park Loop Road, which encircles much of the eastern portion of the park.  The road is open to automobiles, but is a one-way, two-lane road for much of its length.  The Park Loop Road appears to have been re-paved in 2008, making for a very smooth, pleasant ride.  Bikes can be rented in Bar Harbor.</p>
<p>Acadia has the best day hiking in the Eastern U.S.  Walking the miles of trails is one of the best ways to experience the park.  Immerse yourself in the flora and fauna of the island on a number of different hikes of various environment, length, and difficulty. These trails are stunning, with high ocean views, accessible tree lines, steep precipices, stone bridges, etc.</p>

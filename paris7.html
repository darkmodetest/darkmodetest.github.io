Additionally, there are numerous car rental agencies located off-site which provide free airport transfers from their location and may offer lower prices well.</p>
<p>Paris has an excellent public transport system that spans every inch of the city. It is well-known for its Métro (short for Chemin de fer métropolitain, "Metropolitan Railway"), RER (short for Réseau Express Régional, "Regional Express Network,"), and Transilien rail networks. The Métro, RER and  Transilien are complemented by a large network of trams and buses.</p>
<p>Île-de-France Mobilités is the authority that controls and coordinates the different transport companies operating in the Île-de-France region, including Paris. The website and app can be used to plan journeys, track services and purchase tickets.</p>
<p>RATP operates the Métro, buses, and about half of the RER A and B. SNCF operates the rest of the RER, as well as the Transilien. Both companies take the same tickets, so the difference is of little interest for most people except in case of strikes. For example, RATP may strike without SNCF doing so or the other way around.</p>
<p>The Métro and RER move staggering numbers of people into, out of, and around Paris (6.75 million people per day on average), and most of the time in reasonable comfort. However, certain lines are operating at or near capacity, sometimes being so full that you'll have to let one or two trains pass before being able to board. If you can help it, avoid Métro lines 1, 4, and 13 and RER line A and B during rush hours as these are the most congested lines in the system.</p>
<p>Strikes, breakdown and construction are regular occurrences on the Paris public transit system. Generally during a strike, the Métro operates with reduced service and some suburban lines may stop operating altogether. Visit the RATP website for information on which routes are affected. Beware that real-time traffic information and construction announcements are often available only on the French-language version.</p>
<p>Look for the Métro stations, marked with a large "M" sign or with an old-styled sign saying "Métropolitain".</p>
<p>There are 17 Métro lines (lignes) (1-14, 3bis, and 7bis) on which trains travel all day at intervals of a few minutes. Trains usually come 2–3 minutes apart during rush hour and 5–10 minutes apart during other times, depending on the line. The service starts on each end of every line at 05:30, and the last metro arrives on each end at 01:15 (service ends an hour later on Friday and Saturday nights, and the day before a holiday), stopping at all stations on the line. Some lines have rare trains that terminate at an intermediate station; if that happens, get off the train with the rest of the crowd and board the next train on the same track or on the other side of the platform (the driver will usually make an announcement in French). Lines 7 and 13 have a fork, so if you take line 13 north of La Fourche or line 7 south of Maison Blanche, make sure to board the train for the correct destination which is indicated by a lit arrow on the sign in the middle of the platform and on colour-coded binders in each carriage. Times for trains can be seen on an electronic scroll board above the platform. Scheduled times for first and last trains are posted in each station on the centre sign. Generally, except for early and late hours, travellers should not worry about specific Metro train times; just get to your station and take the next train.</p>

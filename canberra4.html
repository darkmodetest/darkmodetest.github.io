Private cars have a 10-minute grace period to enter and leave that area. Close by, there is a Caltex station/Subway Restaurant with limited parking spaces where cars can wait.</p>
<p>Thanks to an expansive NSW TrainLink network and capped pricing, you can travel from Sydney to Canberra, via Goulburn (a terminus of the Sydney suburban train system), on the cheap. First you must take an unbooked Sydney Trains train service from Sydney to Goulburn, costing $8.60, and a subsequent booked TrainLink Xplorer service to Canberra, ranging between $11 and $17 depending on your travel period. This can equate to a saving of $20-30 compared to the direct Xplorer option. Unless you do want to spend time in Goulburn, refer to the timetables to minimise your layover.</p>
<p>NSW TrainLink runs Xplorer train services from Sydney to Canberra three times daily, taking around 4 hours 20 minutes from Sydney's Central Station. Despite being slower than a bus or driving, the train journey takes a very scenic route through the Southern Highlands and the Molongolo Gorge, compared to an unexciting freeway journey by road. Economy train fares cost $56 in peak season (Christmas and New Year period or school holidays) and $40 in off-peak, with discounts sometimes available on last minute or advance bookings. If you do take a bicycle on board they must be boxed and checked-in as luggage on NSW TrainLink services. There is a fee of $12.10 per bicycle and there is room for only three on any train. On some days it is possible to do a day trip by train from Sydney and get 5â€“6 hours to spend in Canberra.</p>
<p>The train terminates at -35.31941149.14932 Canberra Railway Station in Kingston, a suburb located southeast of the main centre of Canberra (Civic) in South Canberra. If you are light on luggage, the cheapest option is to take one of the local Transport Canberra buses which service the station, costing $4.80 to Civic (less if you use a MyWay card). On weekdays, bus route R2 runs every 15 minutes to Civic, with route R2 operating on weekends every 30 minutes. You can also get a taxi from the rank, or book an Uber. You may even be able to walk from the station to your accommodation if you are staying on the southern side of Lake Burley Griffin, taking up to 25-30 minutes depending when you stay.</p>
<p>NSW TrainLink also runs a once-daily train/bus between Melbourne and Canberra: the bus runs from the centre of Canberra (City Bus Interchange) via the Barton Highway, Burley Griffin Way and the Olympic Highway to the town of Cootamundra, where travellers switch to the XPT (NSW TrainLink) to Melbourne's Southern Cross Station; tickets cost $91 in off-peak and $107 in peak season.</p>
<p>V/Line runs a competing train/bus service (Canberra Link) between Melbourne and Canberra daily.  Coaches depart from the Jolimont Centre coach terminal (across the road from the City Bus Interchange).   Services run relatively directly via the Barton and Hume Highways and change for the train at Albury. Tickets cost $46.</p>

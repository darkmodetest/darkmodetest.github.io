As the world's largest public square, it is a must-see destination surrounded by monumental buildings, including the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall. The square also features the Monument to the People's Heroes and provides a grand entrance to the Forbidden City through the Tiananmen Gate. </p>
<p>Continuing further south is Qianmen, marking the boundary of the Ming Dynasty Inner City. Here, visitors can explore the bustling pedestrian areas of Qianmen Street and Dashilar Commercial Street (see the Do section below for more details). To the east of Qianmen, and not directly on the Central Axis, lies a 1.5-kilometer preserved section of the Ming Dynasty Inner City wall, now serving as a park. The axis then leads to the Temple of Heaven (天坛), an iconic symbol of Beijing. This magnificent temple complex, surrounded by a lively park, was where emperors of the Ming and Qing Dynasties performed annual ceremonies of prayer for a good harvest. Today, the park is a popular gathering place for locals who enjoy activities like tai chi, calligraphy, and tea drinking.</p>
<p>At the southern end of the Central Axis stands the Yongdingmen Gate, reconstructed in 2005. This gate once marked the boundary of the Ming Dynasty's Outer City.</p>
<p>Beijing's hutongs, its ancient alleyways, offer a glimpse into traditional architecture dating back to the Yuan Dynasty (1266-1368). These narrow lanes are lined with buildings typically constructed in the traditional courtyard style known as (四合院 sìhéyuàn). Originally, many of these courtyard homes were occupied by aristocrats, but after the Communist takeover in 1949, they were displaced, and poorer families moved in.</p>
<p>Today, hutongs can still be found throughout the area within the 2nd Ring Road, though many had been demolished to make way for new buildings and wider roads. Despite this, some hutong areas, particularly near Qianmen and Houhai, remain popular with tourists. One of the most visited sections is Nanluoguxiang (南锣鼓巷), a historic lane from the Yuan Dynasty that stretches 786 meters long and 8 meters wide, which can become very crowded at peak times.</p>
<p>Beijing is home to numerous green oases that offer a refreshing escape from the city's bustling boulevards and narrow hutongs. These parks and natural spaces are beloved by locals for relaxation, sports, dancing, singing, and general recreation. Some of the best places to experience daily life in Beijing include the expansive Chaoyang Park (朝阳公园) and the more centrally located, compact Ritan Park (日坛公园), both in in the Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>In the central districts of Beijing are the most notable temple and park sites in the city. In the Dongcheng District, you’ll find the Yonghegong (Lama Temple) (雍和宫), one of China's most significant and beautiful temples, along with the nearby Confucius Temple (孔庙). Over in the Xicheng District, Zhongshan Park (中山公园) and Beihai Park (北海公园) are popular green spaces and part of the Central Axis, while the Beijing Zoo (北京动物园) is famous for its traditional landscaping and giant pandas.</p>

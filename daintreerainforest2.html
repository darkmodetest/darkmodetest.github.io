<p>The most iconic one of all in the Daintree is the cassowary, but the park consists largely of broadleaf lowland tropical rainforests and upland tropical rainforests, although there are also significant mangrove and fan palm communities. The rainforest is an amazing array of biodiversity. Look out for the cassowary, a large non-flying bird with a "helmet" growth on its head to protect it as it runs through the forest. Of course, as with all of far northern Australia, saltwater crocodiles are present.</p>
<p>The Daintree Rainforest contains about 30% of the frog, marsupial and reptile species in Australia, and 65% of Australia's bat and butterfly species. 18% of bird species in the country can be found in this single rainforest not to forget there are over 12,000 species of insects in this rainforest. All of this diversity is contained within a single rainforest that takes up only 0.2% of Australia.</p>
<p>Tropical climate with moderate seasonal variations. The southern summer (November to March) is the rainy season and is best avoided – that time of year is also cyclone season.</p>
<p>The most accessible way to the world's oldest living rainforest is via car. </p>
<p>From the tropical city of Cairns, use State Route 44 Captain Cook Highway from either National Route 1 or State Route 91, passing through Port Douglas continue until you reach the town of Mossman. Once you have arrived at Mossman, you have basically arrived at the forest, but the routes divert into two. If you are heading to the Mossman Gorge, turn onto Johnston Road, and if you're heading north to places like Daintree Village or Cape Trib, continue straight.</p>
<p>If you want to get to Cape Tribulation, you will need to take the Daintree River ferry, which is free of charge taking you across the Daintree River. Once you have crossed the river, the road just heads north and most of the POIs are along the way.</p>
<p>TransNorthBus services has bus services from Cairns to Wonga.</p>
<p>There are no fees to enter into the rainforest, or the national park. However, tour buses may charge a fee, including the shuttle bus from visitor centre to the walks in Mossman Gorge. </p>
<p>You will need camping permits if you plan to camp at the grounds.</p>
<p>It's easiest to get around by car, but buses run from Cairns and Port Douglas all the way up to Cape Tribulation. Many companies offer packages of accommodation and transport to the area.</p>
<p>Some of the hostels rent bicycles which is a pleasant way to get around Daintree Village and see the sights while you're there. The ride from Cow Bay to Cape Tribulation is about 25 km (16 mi) each way and a nice daytrip, although a bit hilly in the Noah Range area.</p>
<p>The road is an asphalt road all the way to Cape Tribulation and all rental companies allow cars to travel as far as the Cape. 4WDs are required only for the Bloomfield Track.</p>

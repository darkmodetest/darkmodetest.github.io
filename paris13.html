Most speak English well. A simple "Bonjour Monsieur / Madame, parlez-vous anglais?" should suffice.</p>
<p>Renting a bike is a very good alternative over driving or using public transport and an excellent way to see the sights. Riding a bike anywhere in the city is far safer for the moderately experienced cyclists than almost any town or city in the United States. The French are very cognizant of cyclists, almost to a point of reverence. Paris hasn't always been the easiest place to get around by bike, but that is no longer the case. The city government has taken a number of steps in strong support of improving the safety and efficiency of the urban cyclist as well, in establishing some separated bike lanes, creating a bikesharing system, and allowing cyclists to share the ample bus lanes on most major boulevards. Paris also has many riverside paths which are perfect for cycling. The Paris bike network now counts over 150 km of either unique or shared lanes for the cyclist. In addition, the narrower, medieval side streets of the central arrondissements make for rather scenic and leisurely cycling, especially during off-hours of the day when traffic is lighter. Do remember to bring a good map, since there is no grid plan to speak of and almost all of the smaller streets are one-way.</p>
<p>To get a great orientation of the city on foot while seeing many of Paris' major sights, you can do a West to East walk along the Axe Historique from the Arc de Triomphe to Île de la Cité (Notre Dame). This walk takes about 1-2 hours without any stops. Start at the top of the Champs Elysées (at the Arc de Triomphe) and begin walking down the Champs Elysées towards Place ('square') de la Concorde.</p>
<p>While the streets of Paris are generally fairly easy on novice cyclists, there are some streets in the city that should be avoided by those who do not have sufficient urban cycling experience. Rue de Rivoli, Place de la Bastille, and Place de la Nation are particularly hairy, especially during weekdays and the Saturday evening rush, and should not be navigated by anyone not confident in their ability to cycle in heavy traffic. Avenue des Champs-Elysées, Place de l'Étoile, and voie Georges Pompidou (the lower-level express lanes along the banks of the Seine) should be avoided at all times.</p>
<p>Paris has a bike share system known as Vélib', ☏ +33 1 76 49 12 34. In January 2018, the original Vélib' was replaced by a new system called Vélib' Métropole, that encompasses an ever larger area than the previous one. At first there were some technical issues, but by the end of 2018 it seems like they were mostly resolved. Bikes include a screen showing eg. how long a bike has been rented. Some electric bikes are also available (for an extra fee). €5 per day, first half hour free. (updated Feb 2019) You can purchase the Vélib pass online. An app helps finding stations and available parking slots. Green Vélib bikes are normal bikes, blue Vélibs are ebikes.</p>

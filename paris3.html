Gustave Eiffel's famous tower, the first metro lines, most of the parks, and the streetlights (which are partly believed to have given the city its epithet "the city of light") all come from this period. Another source of the epithet comes from Ville Lumière, a reference not only to the revolutionary electrical lighting system implemented in the streets of Paris, but also to the prominence and aura of Enlightenment the city gained in that era.</p>
<p>The twentieth century was hard on Paris, but thankfully not as hard as it could have been. Both world wars took a heavy toll on the city's inhabitants, but at least Hitler's order to burn the city was ignored by the German General von Choltitz, who was quite possibly convinced by a Swedish diplomat that it would be better to surrender and be remembered as the saviour of Paris, rather than its destroyer. Following the war, the city recovered quickly at first, but slowed in the 1970s and 1980s when Paris began to experience some of the problems faced by big cities everywhere: pollution, housing shortages, and occasionally failed experiments in urban renewal.</p>
<p>However, post-war Paris enjoyed considerable growth as a multi-cultural city, with new immigrants from all corners of the world, especially La Francophonie, including most of northern and western Africa as well as Indochina. These immigrants brought their foods and music, both of which are of prime interest for many travellers. Immigration and multi-culturalism continues in the 21st century with a marked increase in the arrival of people from Latin America, especially Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. In the late 1990s, it was hard to find good Mexican food in Paris, whereas today there are dozens of possibilities from lowly taquerias in the outer arrondissements to nice sit-down restaurants on the boulevards. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Paris remains a French city; bistros, baguettes, high-end fashion, art, accordions, Hausmann architecture, and all the stereotypes (whether good or bad) of France are alive and well in Paris. People from all over France flock to Paris for work, study, partying, and everything in between. After all, this IS the capital of France, so anything pertaining to France can be found here.</p>
<p>The 21st century has also seen vast improvements in the general livability of Paris, with the mayor's office concentrating on reducing pollution and improving facilities for soft forms of transportation including a huge network of cycle paths, larger pedestrian districts and new metro lines. Visitors who normally arrive car-less are the beneficiaries of these policies as much as the Parisians themselves, although tensions and doubts have emerged over the actual benefits of those measures.</p>
<p>Paris has an oceanic climate with moderately cold winters and warm summers. The moderating effect of the Atlantic Ocean helps to temper temperature extremes in much of western Europe, including France. Even in January, the coldest month, temperatures nearly always exceed the freezing point with an average high of 7 °C (45 °F). Snow is not common in Paris, although it can fall a few times per year. Most of Paris' precipitation comes in the form of light rain year-round. Daylight hours run from 08:45 until 16:45.</p>

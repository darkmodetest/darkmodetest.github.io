The hotels claim to be 3-star, but they have no pool or spa, and their room rates range from Rp350,000 to Rp450,000. They are spread through Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Denpasar near the Bypass and aimed at domestic tourists, though foreign tourists are also welcome. One advantage is the hotels are always near the crowd, which Indonesians prefer, with minimarkets and cheap/modest food stalls around the hotels. The locations are 1-2 km from the beach.</p>
<p>Like most of Southeast Asia, there are only a couple hotels in Bali that have family room, triple or quadruple room. The closest option would be to book two rooms with a connecting door, though it may be more expensive than one whole family suite. Most hotels count a kid over 2 years old as an adult, while others allow one child up to 10 years old accompanying the adults without extra bed for free.</p>
<p>Bali has become famous for its large collection of private villas for rent, complete with staff and top-class levels of service. Low labour costs result in single villas boasting staff teams of up to 30 people at the really high end. A private villa rental can be a great option for a visit to Bali, but it pays to be aware of the potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>Not every place sold as a villa actually fits the bill. Prices vary widely and some operators claim to go as low as US$30 per night, which usually means a standalone bungalow on hotel grounds with little actual privacy. Realistically, costs will be upwards of US$200 per night for anything with a decent location and a private pool. At the top of the range, nightly rents can easily exceed US$1,000. The general rule of you get what you pay for applies here. There are, of course, exceptions, but a 4 bedroom villa offered for US$400 and one for US$800 per night will be different in many ways: the standard of maintenance, the number of staff and their English ability, and the overall quality of furnishings and fittings in the property.</p>
<p>Look carefully as to who is running the villa. Is it run by the owner, a local company, a western company or by local staff who answer to an absent overseas owner? And who you are renting through: directly from the owner, a management company, an established villa agent or one who just opened a month ago after his friend Nyoman told him how easy it was? Each path has its pros and cons. If it is an agency, see if there are press reviews. Ask how long the villa has been taking commercial guests, as villas normally take a year or so to get to best service levels. In the first six to 12 months of operation, great villas may offer introductory rates that are well below market value to gain awareness. In all circumstances thoroughly examine and query the security arrangements, especially if dealing with an apparently inexperienced or opportunistic operator to ensure you are not exposing yourself or your belongings to any unnecessary risks.</p>

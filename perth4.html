Their "Great Southern" routes are to Albany, with one service continuing to Katanning.</p>
<p>Integrity Coach Lines run from Midland Station, 10 km east of downtown, and pick up at Wellington Street Perth opposite the central metro station (on some routes it's vice versa). They run north two or three times a week via the coastal Highway 1 to Dongara, Geraldton, Carnarvon, Coral Bay, Exmouth, Port Hedland and Broome. A less frequent service cuts inland along the Great Northern Highway via Mount Magnet and Newman to Port Hedland. At Broome you can transfer to the Greyhound Australia coach to Darwin, from where coaches run to Alice Springs, Adelaide, and the eastern cities of Australia.</p>
<p>South West Coach Lines run from southwestern towns including Busselton, Bunbury, Margaret River, Manjimup, Collie and Dunsborough, to Perth Airport and Elizabeth Quay downtown.</p>
<p>There is no regular bus across the Nullarbor Plain between Perth and Adelaide, but there are adventure-oriented tours that include camping and sightseeing. The only one operating on a regular basis is Nullabor Traveller, which has 9/10 day tours. These depart eastbound from Perth (Sundays), westbound from Adelaide (Wednesdays), once a week in summer (Nov-Jan) slowing to once a month off-season, and not running mid-winter. Tour price is around $1600 per person.</p>
<p>Driving to Perth from Adelaide (2700 km) or Darwin (4100 km) is possible, as the road quality is good, and there's fuel, food and accommodation along the main highways. But it will take the best part of a week each way; that means a week of solid driving, with little time for sights or activities en route. Locals would consider it a 'once in a lifetime' excursion, which is their typically understated Australian way of saying "Hell, never again, mate!" Only attempt these drives if your car is in good repair. Australians and foreign visitors alike run the risk of death by dehydration if a breakdown leaves them stranded in the outback.</p>
<p>The Perth metropolitan area has a fairly reliable and inexpensive public transport system operated by Transperth. Information about timetables, disruptions or service alterations can be found on their website, by calling ‚òè 13 62 13 (domestic) or at 'Transperth InfoCentres' at the central train station in the City.</p>
<p>There are two ways to pay your fare:</p>
<p>Fare payments cannot be made using a contactless credit or debit card but an upgrade to do so is underway as of 2025.</p>
<p>The Transperth system is divided into 9 concentric zones, and the Free Transit Zone. Your fare is calculated based on the number of zones you travel through. All journeys on the Transperth system are capped at a two-zone fare. A one zone fare costs $3.50 ($3.15 with SmartRider) whilst a two zone fare costs $5.20 ($4.68 with SmartRider). A $10 daily cap also applies.</p>
<p>The Free Transit Zone applies to all train and bus services within the CBD and surrounds. Train passengers need a SmartRider card to avail of this service; just tag on and tag off and no funds will be deducted. Bus passengers do not need a SmartRider card to avail of this service; just get on. In addition to the free transit zone, Central Area Transit (CAT) buses are free for their entire route. There are five routes (red, blue, yellow, green, purple). Some buses match the colour, others will have the colour written on their front and side signs.</p>

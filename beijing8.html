But if you spend any significant amount of time cycling in Beijing, you will probably start adopting more creative approaches. These can be learned by finding a local cyclist going your way and following him or her across the intersection.</p>
<p>Several professional bike rental companies, as well as major hotels and some hostels, rent bikes on an hourly basis. For those who need the security of a guide, a bike touring company like Baja Bikes Beijing would be a great way to go.</p>
<p>Beijing's bus system is especially convenient for short trips, particularly when your starting point or destination is not within walking distance of a subway station. Subway stations can often be over 1 km away from your desired location, and navigating the subway system can be time-consuming, especially when factoring in entering and exiting stations. Riding the bus also gives you the opportunity to view the city as you travel, unlike the subway, which keeps you underground.</p>
<p>Buses are also an economical choice, particularly for those on a tight budget. While typical subway fares range from ¥3 to ¥7, bus fares start at ¥2, with distance-based pricing. You can receive a 50% discount on bus fares if you use the Beijing Transportation Card instead of paying with cash. Note that tour lines and direct express lines have their own fare systems. When using the card, remember to touch in and out on most bus lines to ensure the correct fare is charged.</p>
<p>Beijing buses are equipped with air conditioning, heating during winter, TVs, scrolling screens displaying stops in Chinese (often with English), and broadcast systems announcing stops in both Chinese and English. However, bus staff typically speak little English, and bus stop signs are usually in Chinese. If you need assistance, you can call the English-speaking operators at the Beijing Public Transport Customer Helpline (96166).</p>
<p>Bus lines are numbered from 1–999. Buses under 300 serve the city center, while those 300 and above connect the city center with distant areas. Buses in the 800s and 900s link Beijing with its outer suburbs. Special lines, express services, and night buses have specific prefixes or numbering.</p>
<p>Directions can be obtained on AutoNavi Maps, Baidu Maps, or Mapbar. Most maps are in Chinese, but AutoNavi Maps are available in foreign languages in Apple Maps or Google Maps. Apple Maps users can also access the 'live bus' feature in Transit mode.</p>
<p>Most buses with a line number under 200 run daily from 05:00-23:00. Buses numbered 300 and above typically run from 06:00-22:00. Night buses usually operate from 23:20-04:50. Routes can be very crowded during rush hours (06:30-09:00 and 17:00-21:00). On major holidays, most city routes have more frequent service.</p>
<p>Two bus stations of particular interest to tourists are Deshengmen and Dongzhimen. Deshengmen provides access to the Badaling section of the Great Wall and locations in the northwest outskirts of Beijing, while Dongzhimen serves the northern and northeastern sections of the Great Wall, as well as other outlying destinations in the northeast.</p>

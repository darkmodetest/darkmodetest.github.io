The Van Gogh Museum has the largest collection of Van Gogh's paintings and drawings in the world. The Stedelijk Museum is all about modern art, contemporary art and design. A newer addition to Amsterdam's already stellar set of art museums is the Hermitage in Plantage, the largest satellite branch of the famous museum from Saint Petersburg, Russia.</p>
<p>A major museum is the Anne Frank House, dedicated to Anne Frank, a Jewish girl who kept a diary while hiding from Nazi persecution in hidden rooms at the rear of a building in the Canal District (known as the Achterhuis). It's an exhibition on the life of Anne Frank, but also highlights other forms of persecution and discrimination. Amsterdam has hundreds of museums about pretty much every topic one could think of. They are described in the city's district articles.</p>
<p>The Museumkaart costs €64.90 (or €32.45 for those under 18 years old). It covers the cost of admission to over 400 museums across the Netherlands and you can buy it at most major museums. Note that if you do not buy it in advance, you will be issued a temporary card that is only valid for 5 museum visits over a period of 30 days until you receive the permanent card, which can be mailed to a Dutch address after being registered. It is valid for an entire year, and you will need to write your name, birthday, and gender on it. If you are going to the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, those are €22.5 each, so this card can quickly pay for itself. The tickets to the major museums, including the audio guide, can be bought early from the tourist information desk at no extra cost. Alternatively, for short stays, you can consider buying the I amsterdam City Card[dead link], starting at €42 per day, which includes "free" access to Amsterdam museums, public transport and discounts on many tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Since the Middle Ages, the Netherlands has been a country with a relatively high degree of freedom and tolerance towards other religions and cultures, especially compared to other countries in Europe, with the major exception being the persecution of Catholics after winning the war with Spain and during and after the Eighty Years' War.  Between 1590 and 1800, the estimated foreign-born population was never less than 5 percent, many of them settling in Amsterdam. This led to a large migration of Jews, Huguenots (French Protestants), Flemings, Poles and other people to the city. Jews in particular had a large presence in Amsterdam, notably in the Jodenbuurt, though this quarter has changed significantly after World War II. The most prominent synagogue is The Esnoga (or The Portuguese Synagogue), built in 1675 in an austere Classicist style.</p>
<p>As the Netherlands was a Protestant nation, most of the churches are from this branch of Christianity. The oldest church in Amsterdam, the Netherlands-gothic Oude Kerk on the Oudezijds Voorburgwal at Oudekerksplein, is now surrounded by window prostitution. It was built in 1306, and became a Calvinist church after the Reformation in 1578. The Nieuwe Kerk, at Dam Square, dates from the 15th century and is now used for royal coronations and exhibitions. From the 17th century onwards, four compass churches were built that would serve the areas outside the Binnenstad.</p>

For craft beer enthusiasts, Great Leap Brewing (大跃) and Slowboat are notable local microbreweries. Great Leap has a unique location nestled in the hutongs near Gulou.</p>
<p>Most of Beijing's bars are located in one of the bar clusters around the city.  In the beginning there was only one was Sanlitun, but many areas have emerged.</p>
<p>Beijing offers a wide range of accommodations starting with budget options under 300 yuan. Rates for a four-star hotel typically start at around 500 yuan, while five-star hotels range from 1,200 to 2,100 yuan. Several luxury hotels exceed the typical rates of standard five-star options, including the Rosewood Beijing, Peninsula Beijing, Mandarin Oriental Wangfujing, and the ultra-luxurious Bvlgari Hotel. Most of the expensive hotels are found in the Dongcheng District and along the eastern 3rd Ring Road in Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>For unique overnight experiences, particularly near the Great Wall, consider staying in the outlying areas. One option is to pitch a tent on the Great Wall and sleep under the shelter of a guard tower. The easiest way to arrange this is by visiting the village of Chenjiapu in Yanqing District, where the Chen family at Great Wall Fresh can rent you a tent for 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, international tourism in China is still recovering, resulting in a limited number of hostels with foreign travelers and backpackers at any given time. A notable option for backpackers is the Pagoda Light (北京白塔之光酒店), located next to the beautiful 13th-century Baitasi stupa in the Xicheng District. This hostel features a rooftop café and restaurant with a grand view of the stupa. While Airbnb does not operate in China, you can explore alternative options by searching for hosts on Couchsurfing.</p>
<p>For longer-term accommodation, be prepared to splurge as Beijing's real estate prices are among the highest in the world, even surpassing those in Western European cities. Expect to spend around 7,000-8,000 yuan per month for a short-term lease on a studio apartment in the city center.</p>
<p>Free emergency telephone numbers:</p>
<p>Remember these three telephone numbers; they are valid in almost every part of China.</p>
<p>Beijing, despite its size, is a very safe city, with violent crime being incredibly rare. It is generally safe for women to walk alone at night, and there is a significant police presence in the city center.</p>
<p>Tourists visiting Beijing should be vigilant about scams and petty crime, especially in tourist-heavy areas like Tiananmen Square and routes to the Great Wall. Pickpocketing can happen in crowded places, so it is important to keep your belongings secure and within sight at all times. Taxi-related scams are particularly prevalent, so refer to the "Avoiding scams and fakes" section under the taxi heading for detailed advice on how to navigate this issue safely.</p>
<p>While many Beijing locals are genuinely curious about foreigners and may simply wish to chat or take a photo, it's important to remain cautious and stick to your original plans. If you are approached with an invitation to go somewhere unexpected, it's wise to politely decline and continue with your plans. Be wary of locals—often posing as students or artists—who invite tourists to exhibitions or tea tastings, which can lead to pressure to make expensive purchases.</p>

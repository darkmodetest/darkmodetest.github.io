Go to the beaches of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak at sunset and find steaming hot bakso, a delightful meatball and noodle soup, served up fresh for a very inexpensive Rp 5,000. You can season it yourself but be forewarned: Indonesian spices can be ferociously hot. Go easy until you find your heat tolerance level!</p>
<p>Padang restaurants are a good choice for both the budget conscious and those visitors wishing to experience authentic Indonesian (but not Balinese) cuisine. These are usually marked with a prominent masakan padang sign and serve food from Padang, Sumatra. The options are usually stacked on plates in the window. You choose what you want and it is served with steamed rice. The most famous Padang speciality is rendang sapi (spicy beef coconut curry) but there are always a number of chicken, fish, egg and vegetable options. Padang food is always halal, and you'll eat well for Rp 15,000–20,000.</p>
<p>Actual Balinese food is common on the island but it has made few inroads in the rest of the country due to its emphasis on pork, which is anathema to the largely Muslim population in the rest of the country. Notable dishes include:</p>
<p>Other Balinese specialities include:</p>
<p>Unlike Indian Hindus, virtually all Balinese eat meat, and vegetarianism has traditionally been limited to part-time fasts for some priests. Cows, however, are considered sacred, so Balinese traditional foods do not include beef but do include pork, which is not halal for Muslims. It's best to assume that all local food is non-vegetarian unless assurances are given to the contrary. In particular, the Indonesian spice paste sambal is a hot paste of ground red chillies, spices and usually shrimp paste. Always check to see if the sambal being served to you contains shrimp paste—you can find it without at a few places. Additionally, kerupuk crackers with a spongy appearance contain shrimp or fish. As an alternative, ask for emping, a delicious meat-free cracker made from bean paste—it resembles a fried potato chip in appearance. Restaurants catering to tourists do nearly always provide some vegetarian options, and in places like Seminyak and Ubud there are even dedicated vegetarian restaurants.</p>
<p>Halal restaurants catering to the Muslim minority exist, but may require a little searching for and tend to be downmarket. Padang restaurants (mentioned above) are a good option, and Muslims may also be able to eat in Javanese or Sundanese restaurants. Kosher food is virtually unknown.</p>
<p>A meal in a basic tourist-oriented restaurant will be around Rp 20,000–50,000/person. In a local restoran or warung the same meal might be about Rp 15,000 or less. Simple warungs or sometimes small tables in pedestrian zones sell nasi bungkus/nasi Bali (a pyramid-shaped banana leaf/paper-wrapped parcel of about 400 g of rice with several tasty extras such as shredded chicken, pindang egg, noodles and chili to take away) for not more than Rp 10,000. One very reliable option is nasi campur (rice with several options, chosen by the purchaser) for about Rp 10,000-15,000. Rice is often served at ambient temperature with the accompanying food much hotter, this is common practice in Indonesia.</p>

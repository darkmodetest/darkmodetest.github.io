There are approximately 750,000 people living in Amsterdam and they own about 800,000 bicycles. The city is very, very bike-friendly, and there are separate bike lanes on most major streets. In the city centre, however, there is often not enough space for a bike lane, so cars and cyclists share narrow streets.</p>
<p>Cycling is the main mode of transport for most locals in the city and traffic is high paced. Be mindful of your surroundings and consider that if you don't have much experience cycling, you might be more comfortable using public transport or walking.</p>
<p>Cyclists do not have the right of way even though it might appear like that when observing the typical Amsterdammer's cycling behaviour. Be very careful and watch out for other cyclists. Always show other traffic where you're going (e.g. by holding out your hand) in order to avoid accidents and smoothen the traffic flow. If not indicated otherwise by signs, the right-before-left rule applies.</p>
<p>Avoid getting your tyre in the tram rails; it's a nasty fall. Always cross tram rails at an angle. When crossing tram lines, watch out for fast-approaching taxis, which have a rather ruthless driving style. Let none of the above deter you from doing it the Amsterdam way. Rent a bike! There are bike rental shops at railway stations and several others in and around the city centre. Bikes cost about €9 to €20 per day. Bring wet gear.</p>
<p>A good map for cycling routes, repairs, rentals and also public transport is Amsterdam op de fiets (a Cito-plan). Bicycles can be taken for free on all ferries across the IJ, on all metros, and on some carriages of tram 26 with a bike supplement fee on the OV-chipkaart (€6.20 in 2018, not allowed in rush hours). Use the special bike racks, locations indicated by a bicycle sign on the outside of the carriage.</p>
<p>Make sure to get a good lock (or two), and to use it. Amsterdam has one of the highest bicycle theft rates in the world. If you are buying a bike, prices that seem too good to be true are stolen bikes. Any bike offered for sale to passers-by, on the street, is certainly stolen. There's an old Amsterdam joke: when calling out to a large group of cyclists passing by "Hey, that's my bike!" about five people will jump off "their" bikes and start running.</p>
<p>The bicycle is a good way to explore the surrounding countryside. Within half an hour you're out of town. Go north, take the ferry across the IJ and cycle to Waterland. Or go south, into the Amsterdamse Bos, a giant park, or follow the river Amstel where Rembrandt worked. You can also take your bike onto the metro to the end of line station Gaasperplas, and cycle along rivers and windmills to old fortified towns like Weesp, Muiden and Naarden.</p>
<p>The ride-hailing services of Uber and Bolt are available in Amsterdam. With them you can avoid a lot of the problems associated with taking an Amsterdam taxi from busy areas (Centraal Station/Leidseplein) and at peak evening hours.</p>

The airport has four terminals, which for ground transport purposes can be regarded as two precincts. T1 and T2 are side-by-side to the east of the runway, while T3 and T4 are side-by-side to the west. A free bus plies between the two precincts, taking 15 min.
 
T1 and T2 have a direct rail link to the city, with fares a flat $5. The railway station serving T3 and T4 is Redcliffe Station about 15 minutes walk from the airport or you can use the shuttle bus which leaves from a lane about 20 metres outside the T4 entrance. Public buses also serve the airport, and taxis and rental cars are available. 
 
Perth is the most important gateway to the west coast of Australia. In addition to flights from Asia, there are nonstop flights from Mauritius, Johannesburg, Auckland and London Heathrow, the latter being the first regular nonstop route between Europe and Australia and at launch the world's longest nonstop passenger flight. There are domestic flights from the largest cities in Australia and regional flights from smaller airports in Western Australia.   (updated Oct 2018)</p>
<p>Once it was the only way to reach Perth and the rest of Australia, often in chains. Nowadays a dwindling number of freight ships have passenger places available to Fremantle from Southeast Asia, Los Angeles and San Diego USA, and very rarely all the way from Europe. Their facilities are pretty basic and mundane, more like a hostel bunkhouse with added sea-sickness than a Conradian salty adventure.</p>
<p>For a luxurious arrival at a splurgy price, come on one of the cruise ships which call regularly at Fremantle, including the Queen Mary 2 and Queen Victoria. These often offer one-way cruises to and from Fremantle, usually to other Australian cities, to New Zealand, and to Southeast Asia. They sail most often in summer, seldom in winter. Check the schedule here and you'll need to book many months in advance.</p>
<p>Most long-distance and regional trains run to East Perth, 1 km NE of the city. It's part of the Public Transport Centre so many city buses and metro trains serve it, and there are taxis. The Australind train from Bunbury arrives at Platform 3 of Perth Station.</p>
<p>The Indian Pacific runs to Perth from Sydney and Adelaide. It is more expensive than flying and takes longer than driving yourself, but this journey, which takes four days and three nights, is one of the world's great train journeys. You can bring your car on the train with you only if you are travelling to/from Adelaide, but not Sydney. The train traverses the longest stretch of straight track of any railway in the world (478 km) as it journeys across the Nullarbor.</p>
<p>Regional train services are operated by Transwa. Their four routes are:</p>
<p>The main operators of long-distance and inter-city coaches in Western Australia are the government-run Transwa, and Integrity Coaches.</p>
<p>Transwa buses run from the Public Transport Centre in East Perth. They run overnight north up the coast (both by Brand Highway 1, and Coastal Highway 60) to Dongara, Geraldton, and Kalbarri. To go further north, take the Integrity Coach, described below.</p>

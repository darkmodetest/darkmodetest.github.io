<p>Cruise ships stop for tours, shopping, or to begin or end a cruise. Some ships still anchor off-shore toward the southeast side of the island and tender guests to shore. Modest sized ships can choose to dock at the port of Benoa not far from Denpasar, Kuta and Sanur. In 2018, 75 ships docked at Benoa Port. There the dock area is has an industrial pier with few amenities and no ATMs, but taxis and private car operators when cruise ships dock there. It also has a multi-purpose pier with an open-air terminal building.  It has a currency exchange and modest concessionaires, taxis at the ready, and space for many medium buses for tours. At both piers, taxis for cruisers may have high fixed prices to popular destinations. They should instead use their meters, sometimes adding tolls when use of causeways necessary. Private cars for hire will often require patient negotiation on price.</p>
<p>Other ships also run from Candi Dasa and Amed, and the operators can pick up at Nusa Dua, Ngurah Rai International Airport and even Ubud. But only few of the operators can serve flop destinations such as visiting 2 or 3 destinations. It should be arranged in advanced, because it's not easy to flop from one island of Gilis to the others and also to Senggigi. Their "cruise" ship fees often include pick up at hotels or airport.</p>
<p>It is also possible to access Bali by car from Java’s major cities, albeit a very long distance. For instance, you must spend approximately 18 hours (total, plus ferries and the overall duration from Gilimanuk to Denpasar)  for a drive from Jakarta to Denpasar. Through Surabaya, which is much closer, lets you spend lesser time – 10 hours. From Semarang, you must drive for 13 hours, and from Bandung, 18 hours. Ferry costs at Banyuwangi cost around Rp.141,000 to Rp.159,000 for a regular passenger car.</p>
<p>From Mataram, it is a 4-to-5 hour drive plus ferries; from Lombok, also plus ferries, is a 5-hour drive.</p>
<p>Bali is a large island and you will need a way to get around if you plan on exploring more than the hotel pool. Rapid, seemingly uncontrolled development and aging infrastructure mean that the roads struggle to cope. In major tourist areas the traffic is chaotic, and there are daily traffic jams. Particular blackspots are Ubud, Kuta, Seminyak and Denpasar.</p>
<p>For different excursions around the island, it is common to join a tour via your hotel or at one of the many street agencies which are found everywhere in booths normally marked "Tourist Information". These booths make a commission on any tours they sell you.</p>
<p>Once you arrive at your destination you may encounter difficult walking conditions as sidewalks in most parts of Bali are simply the covered tops of storm-water drains and in many places only 60 cm (2 ft) wide. This makes for uncomfortable single-file walking next to traffic. Often sidewalks are blocked by a motorbike or a caved-in section, necessitating dangerous darting into traffic. Many of the island's conventional streets are simply not pedestrian friendly. Beach areas and major tourist areas are easier to walk around; Seminyak and Sanur in particular have a wide, walkable beachfront with many cafes and bars. But although the walking conditions are difficult, they are by no means impossible. Lots of tourists and locals travel the roads by foot, and even the traffic is generally very accommodating to pedestrians if it is given time to react.</p>

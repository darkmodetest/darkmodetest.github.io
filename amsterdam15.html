Australians, New Zealanders and Canadians are afforded a one-year working-holiday visa. In general the employer must apply for work permits. Immigration is easier for higher educated (Bachelor's or higher) earning a gross annual salary of over €45000 (over €33000 for those under 30).</p>
<p>The main central shopping streets run in a line from Centraal Station to the Leidseplein: Nieuwendijk, Kalverstraat, Heiligeweg, Leidsestraat. The emphasis is on clothing and fashion, but there are plenty of other shops. These are not upmarket shopping streets, and the north end of Nieuwendijk is a bit seedy. English-language books can be found in the shops around Spui, and a used book market is held there every Friday. There is a concentration of Chinese shops in Zeedijk and Nieuwmarkt, and flowers can be bought at the Bloemenmarkt. However, do not buy bulbs there. They are usually too old to have even a slight chance of growing. Other concentrations of shops in the centre are Utrechtsestraat, Spiegelstraat (art and antiques) and Staalstraat (specialty shops).</p>
<p>Interesting independent shops and boutiques are located in the side streets of the main canals (Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht) and especially in the Jordaan. The Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk are claimed as best shopping streets in the Netherlands. The area around Museumplein in Zuid has Amsterdam's upmarket shopping streets. The P.C. Hooftstraat and the Cornelis Schuytstraat have the finest designer shops in the city. You can find designer shoes, health and well-being specialists, massage parlors, fashion boutiques, designer interiors, designer florists and specialist shops. The partly gentrified neighbourhood of De Pijp—around Ferdinand Bolstraat and Sarphatipark—is slowly becoming the 'second Jordaan'.</p>
<p>Street markets originally sold mainly food, and most still sell food and clothing, but they have become more specialized. The Albert Cuyp Market is the largest in Amsterdam, and the best-known street market in the country. The Waterloopleinmarkt is partly a flea market, partly an alternative and second hand clothing and accessories market. It is more oriented towards tourists than to locals. If you're looking for authenticity, visit the Dappermarkt in Oost or the Ten Katemarkt in West. Both have food, households, flowers and clothing, and have a multicultural flavor.</p>
<p>In the areas surrounding the city centre, the main shopping streets are the Kinkerstraat, Ferdinand Bolstraat, Van Woustraat, and the Javastraat. The most ethnically diverse shopping street in Amsterdam is the Javastraat. There are some toy stores and clothing shops for kids in the centre, but most are in the shopping streets further out, because that's where families with children live. Particularly IJburg has a good set of shops for families.</p>
<p>Amsterdam's culinary scene boasts a vibrant tapestry of flavours, offering a rich variety of dining experiences. The city unfolds as a treasure trove for those craving Asian cuisine, albeit catered to the milder local palate. Adventurous taste buds, fear not – it's not impossible to find spicy food.</p>
<p>Most noticeably, a legacy of Dutch colonial history is woven into the dining fabric, evident through the profusion of Indonesian and Surinamese restaurants. Like other cities filled with tourists, Amsterdam's true culinary scene can be found along the quieter byways, where value and authenticity often intermingle away from the bustling tourist centres.</p>

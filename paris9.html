Trains can run up to every 5 minutes during rush hour, and you will never have to wait for more than 1 hour between two trains, even on the least served lines in the evening or on the weekend. The Transilien is marginally less crowded than the RER and the Metro.</p>
<p>Most tourists will not encounter the trams as they run only on the outskirts of the city. Trams T3a & T3b go nearly three quarters of the way round the city at the edge. Tram line 7 connects Orly Airport with Métro line 7; it is cheap but not fast.</p>
<p>A bus ride is interesting if you want to see more of the city. All stops have a name and are clearly marked on the street. At complex intersections, stops usually have a map that lets you know where other lines stop and if applicable where to find a Métro entrance. If more than one line stops, wave to the driver to let them know you want to board. All buses have a schematic map of the line on display with all stop names, bus connections and major street names. Electronic displays inside each bus tell riders its current position and what stops remain, but don't overly rely on them as they don't always work.</p>
<p>Since the Métro is primarily structured around a hub-and-spoke model, there are some journeys for which it can be quite inefficient. In these cases it is worth seeing if a direct bus route exists, despite the complexity of the bus network.</p>
<p>Noctilien, night buses run regularly through the central hub at Chatelet to outlying areas of greater Paris. There is also a circle line connecting the main train stations. It pays to know one's Noctilien route ahead of time in case one misses the last Métro home. Women travellers should probably avoid taking the Noctilien on their own to destinations outside Paris.</p>
<p>A Navigo Travel Card is required to use public transport in Paris city and the wider Île-de-France region. The card can be loaded with a variety of fares (e.g. 10 Metro-Train-RER Tickets). It cannot be loaded with credit like other cards around the world (e.g. OMNY, Oyster or Suica). The card needs to be validated at the start of a journey and when transferring to a new tram or bus. It does not need to be validated at the end of a journey unless required to exit a fare gate.</p>

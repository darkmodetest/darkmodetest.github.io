The city often plays host to cultural and historic celebrations, music festivals and family entertainment, particularly in the Summer holiday months of December, January and February.</p>
<p>Each year, Brisbane also hosts several parades through the central city. These can make great photo opportunities, and include:</p>
<p>Several universities call Brisbane home and there are significant opportunities for international students to enrol in degree programs. Many of them have exchange agreements with several foreign universities.</p>
<p>Take a note of Brisbane's shopping hours before venturing out shopping in the City. Late night shopping is Thursday evenings in the suburbs, and Friday evening in the city centre. Other nights, expect most shops to close at 5PM.</p>
<p>The university and its surrounds provide many quality eateries if you happen to be in the area or on a CityCat ferry and caters to a cheaper market.</p>
<p>Brisbane's drinking and nightlife scene is separated into some distinct areas. Anyone planning a night on the town should be aware that after 3AM, no more patrons are allowed into pubs and clubs. This is a safety measure, coupled with increased security presence at taxi ranks. Additionally, smokers should beware of strict anti-smoking regulations. Smoking is now banned in "all areas where food & drink are served", both indoors and outdoors. This means that smoking is banned in all hotels, clubs, and caf√©s except in designated smoking areas.</p>
<p>The drinking age in Australia is 18 and only an Australian driver's licence, 18+ card or a foreign passport is accepted as proof of age. Other forms of ID such as a student card are not accepted. These regulations are strictly enforced - for nightclubs in particular, your ID will always be checked at the door, and while venues serving food may let you in, most are very prudent in checking ID if you wish to purchase alcohol.</p>
<p>Toowong:</p>
<p>Regatta and the RE have reputations (which they more than live up) as student haunts, being located reasonably close to the St Lucia campus of the University of Queensland.</p>
<p>Bulimba:</p>
<p>Catch a citycat to Bulimba for some trendy shopping on popular Oxford Street, great cafes, hip bars or for a picnic in the park.</p>
<p>Stones Corner</p>
<p>An up-and-coming historic area experiencing a revitalisation in boutiques shops, restaurants, cafes and bars. Only 10 minutes from the CBD by bus.</p>
<p>The Fortitude Valley is a unique area of Brisbane catering to the live music scene. A large number of Brisbane's hippest clubs are located here. Through the 1960s and 70s it was seen as Brisbane's bohemian hub and has maintained a certain degree of that reputation. It became thought of as being one of the more dangerous areas of the city but this attitude is changing as the area becomes more popular and hence, safer. This attitude, however, has had an adverse effect on the area's creative vibe, as locals turn their back on the area, forcing the creative centre of Brisbane to shift towards other areas of the city such as West End and Paddington. As with anywhere, simple common sense, caution and courtesy will keep you out of harm's way.</p>

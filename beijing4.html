Other significant works include Sir Harold Acton’s Peonies and Ponies (1941), Sir Reginald Fleming Johnston’s Twilight in the Forbidden City (1934), and Juliet Bredon’s Peking - A Historical and Intimate Description of Its Chief Places of Interest (1922), written by an Englishwoman who grew up and lived in Beijing until 1924.</p>
<p>The language of Beijing is Mandarin Chinese. Standard Mandarin itself was the administrative language of the Ming and Qing dynasties and was based mainly on the Beijing dialect. For language students, this makes studying in Beijing an excellent chance to learn the language in a form relatively close to the standard. That being said, Beijing dialect has the "er" sound at the end of many words. Hence the ubiquitous lamb kabobs (羊肉串 yáng ròu chuàn) become "yáng ròu chuànr". In addition, the Beijing dialect consists of many local slang words and expressions which have not been incorporated into standard Mandarin. Beijing taxi drivers are famously chatty and will gladly engage students of the language, offering excellent chances to practice the language and get a feel for the changes in the city and country from an "Old Beijinger".</p>
<p>English speakers are not common in Beijing, so it's advisable to carry your hotel's business card in case you get lost. Likewise, ask the hotel staff to write down the names of any tourist attractions you plan to visit in Chinese, so locals can help direct you. The Baidu translation app has a picture translation option that can be very useful.</p>
<p>Other European languages are far less widespread in Beijing.</p>
<p>Some nationalities may enter China visa-free for specific durations. In 2024, new visa rules extended visa-free entry to citizens from a large number of countries for stays up to 15 days. Certain cities also allow transit without a visa for up to 144 hours, with specific onward travel requirements. Beijing participates in this program, enabling visitors to explore nearby areas like Tianjin and Hebei within the 144-hour limit. Travelers from 53 countries transiting to a third country may obtain a 144-hour visa waiver to visit Beijing, neighboring Tianjin, and Hebei. Entry and departure must be through Beijing, Tianjin, or Shijiazhuang airports, or via Tianjin and Qinhuangdao sea ports, and travel beyond the three provincial-level units is strictly forbidden. At immigration, visitors must present an onward ticket to a country other than the one they arrived from, with Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan considered separate countries for this scheme.</p>
<p>Beijing (BJS  IATA for all airports) is served by two major international airports; Beijing Capital International Airport is older and larger of the two, while Beijing Daxing International Airport is a newer airport opened in September 2019. Eventually, the plan is for Star Alliance carriers to serve Capital, and for Skyteam and OneWorld carriers to serve Daxing. Nanyuan Airport, which used to serve China United Airlines, has been closed to civilian air traffic, with all its civilian flights having been taken over by Daxing.</p>

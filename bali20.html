They look amazing and are definitely a very Balinese experience, but they may also shelter little uninvited guests and are best avoided if you have a low tolerance for critters.</p>
<p>Bali hotel prices may be given in three different currencies. Prices in U.S. dollars are most common, particularly away from the budget sector. Euros are sometimes used, particularly at hotels owned by European nationals. Lower-end places usually (but not always) price in Indonesian Rupiah. Some new local web hotels searches usually state payment in Rupiah and also usually include tax and service payment, different with international web hotels searches which stated price exclude any tax and service. If you pay your bill by credit card, then the amount in the currency you agreed to when making the booking is converted to Indonesian Rupiah on the day you pay and your account is charged with that amount of Rupiah. This is because Indonesian banking law does not permit credit card transactions in any other currency. If you pay by cash, you can settle with the currency in which you were quoted the room rate.</p>
<p>It is generally best to seek a rate in Indonesian Rupiah and resist efforts by the hotels and villa owners to quote in a foreign currency unless you are able to make payment in the currency and it is agreeable to you to do so.</p>
<p>It is important to understand the tax and service charge that hotels are obliged to levy by Indonesian law. All high-end and mid-range (and a fair proportion of budget) hotels will levy a 21% tax and service charge on the room rate (the so-called "plus plus"). When you make a booking, you should always ask whether the rate quoted includes or excludes this. Simple budget homestays/losmen and informal accommodation are not obliged to levy these charges. The 21% consists of 11% sales tax which goes to the government and a 10% service charge which should go into a pool shared between the staff.</p>
<p>Be careful when you book/search three-stars hotels or below, because sometimes the hotels have uncommon rules. Different price of one, two or three persons stay. For the three persons sometimes has two options with extra bed (compulsory or not) or without extra bed (extra person). For three persons and more you can share a family room with bunk beds in some hotels and the hotel will provide you a 5-gallon drinking water and its dispenser. With and without breakfast. With breakfast means you have to eat in its small breakfast room. But if you want to eat in your room, additional charge will be added. Some hotels which have no breakfast room, will deliver your breakfast to your room after you telephone the front office or maybe they give a packet breakfast meal in a box or on disposable tray with thin plastic cover. Some hotels will charge you cleaning service charge (at least $5) when your trash bucket is full with your own (rubbish) eat and drink are bought from outside the hotel, but it is not mentioned in the internet, but it is mentioned on the hotel guideline book in your room. Compulsory pickup charge from and to airport is also implemented by some hotels, the other hotels use big vehicle to pick up your group with more charge, but they mention price for small car.</p>

On weekends, most parking spaces have a 4 hour limit, again metered at $1.10-2.20 per hour. All day street spots are sometimes available in the Domain/Mrs Macquarie's Chair and Hickson Road, but these spots are often taken up by commuters, and, since they are metered, an early bird deal may work out cheaper than the metered rate. Parking meters accept credit card payment. Similar prices are charged in North Sydney.</p>
<p>City hotels invariably charge for parking for the guests.</p>
<p>Parking in many major suburban centres and beaches can be a matter of spending time cruising and searching for parking spots. Usually parking within easy walking distance of these centres has a time limit restriction - often 2-3 hours. Shopping centre car parks usually have a similar restriction, with fees applying after an initial free period.</p>
<p>Some train stations have all day free commuter parking. At major stations, this can be full before 8AM. Smaller stations with less frequent train service tend to have better parking availability. On weekends it is easy to find a spot in the commuter parking lots. The stations with commuter parking are marked on the Sydney Trains maps.</p>
<p>Parking at some beaches, on summer weekends, can often be almost impossible. Some beaches are in suburban neighbourhoods, without large car parking facilities. Check the appropriate destination guides for more information.</p>
<p>Parking fines in Sydney are $108 if you exceed the allowed parking time or don't pay the fee in a legitimate parking space. Reloading the meter or moving your car within the same parking zone will not get you out of a fine. Parking in a no stopping zone will cost you over $200 (indicated by signs or a solid yellow line near the kerb). If you park illegally and wait with your car, you may find you have the licence place photographed and fined before you have the chance to move on - don't expect a warning. If you park illegally in a disabled spot, the fine is $541. If you do get fined for exceeding time, you will not be fined again the same day so you might as well enjoy your parking spot.</p>
<p>Clearways are no-stopping zones on main roads during peak periods, marked with clearway signs and a broken yellow line on the kerb. Fines will be around $400 to reclaim your car after it is towed away. Clearways also offer parking opportunities if you want to park just after 10AM.</p>
<p>Speed limits can change frequently, even on the same road. Speed limits drop for areas of pedestrian activity, schools (40 km/h or 30 km/h 8AM-9:30AM and 2:30PM-4PM on school days), roadwork, as well as driving conditions. Some roads have variable speed limits that change during busy traffic times. Every road in Sydney has a signposted speed limit and the only way to be sure of the limit is to pay attention to the signs. You cannot tell the speed limit just by looking at the road. The speed limit is usually 50 km/h on residential streets, 60 km/h to 100 km/h on main roads, and sometimes higher on motorway sections with a max at 110km/h.</p>

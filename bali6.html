The line or corridor 02 serves the route from the airport to the downtown of Denpasar with numerous bus stops might be looked at Moovit app. The bus is the cheapest AC transportation because it is free of charge. An electronic money card like Brizzi, E-money, Flazz or TapCash is required.</p>
<p>There are direct bus services to Bali from all major cities on Java and Lombok that link with ferries for sea crossings. These are cheap and easy, but slow.</p>
<p>Various executive buses with air conditioning are available from some cities in Java, like Bandung, Jakarta, Semarang, Surabaya and Yogyakarta. The ticket can be easily booked from easybook, redbus and traveloka app or website.</p>
<p>Ferries cross from Ketapang on the island of Java to Gilimanuk in western Bali every 15 minutes, 24 hr every day. These are very cheap, and the crossing takes just 30 minutes (plus sometimes considerable waiting around for loading and unloading).</p>
<p>A number of speedboats and catamarans operate into Benoa Harbour near Kuta (~2 hr) and Padangbai (80 minutes) from the Gili Islands of Lombok. These are convenient for some travellers but are frequently priced much higher than the equivalent air crossing. Crossing times are subject to weather and other operational conditions and trip times can longer than those publicised. Benoa Harbour with 12 metre depth received more than 50 ships with more than 1,000 passengers and crew each a year.</p>
<p>Caution should be used in selecting a suitable operator and craft for a fast boat crossing to Lombok. Some of the operators on these routes use inappropriate equipment, overload the boats and have inadequate levels of crew training, personnel and safety equipment. The Lombok Strait fast boat crossing can be subject to inclement weather and equipment breakdowns. Boarding an overloaded craft or departing in adverse weather conditions may lead to serious disappointment. There are no operators offering craft suitable for open water all-weather crossings. Rather they are operating light duty hulled craft of fibreglass or aluminium construction powered by outboard petrol engines. On two previous occasions operators have introduced a more suitably specified and equipped craft powered by diesel inboard engines and with a more robust hull construction appropriate to open water use. Both these craft were withdrawn from service as operations could not be sustained in competition with the lower cost base alternatives. Several of these light duty craft have already sunk or been run onto a reef or beach to avoid foundering whilst carrying passengers. Fortunately they had not yet entered open waters at the time and nearby assistance was available. There have been no fatalities from these incidents.</p>
<p>There are also public ferries from Lembar, Lombok, to Padang Bai every few hours, with the trip taking around 3â€“4 hours. This service has notable safety, operational and equipment standards issues. Some ferries are better than others, or worse depending upon your perspective.</p>
<p>Delays are commonplace with public ferries due to loading and unloading issues. Services may be cancelled or postponed during periods of inclement weather, and sea crossings during the monsoon period can be uncomfortable or dangerous.</p>

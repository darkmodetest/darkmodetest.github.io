<p>For the most up-to-date information:</p>
<p>For a life-threatening medical emergency (unconsciousness, stroke, heart attack, severe bleeding that won't stop, etc.) dial 999 or 112 and ask for an ambulance. These numbers are free of charge from any telephone. When you call, the operator will ask for details about the patients and your location; answering these questions will not delay help. As emergency response is prioritised in London the operator needs to know what resources they need to use and how quickly you need them.</p>
<p>London's ambulance coverage is excellent with highly trained and friendly staff. For instances of major trauma there is also London's Air Ambulance, two helicopters that can deliver an advanced trauma team within minutes to anywhere in London. At night the helicopters do not fly and a rapid response car is dispatched instead.</p>
<p>Emergencies can also be dealt with at most NHS hospitals with an A & E (Accident & Emergency) department. In A & E, be prepared to wait for a long time (although the target is 4 hours, waits can be longer than this) before being given treatment if your medical complaint is not critical. For less serious problems, try an , Urgent Care Centre, or a high-street pharmacist.</p>
<p>Major A & E hospitals in London are:</p>
<p>For advice on non-emergency medical problems, you can ring the 24 hour NHS Direct service on 111.</p>
<p>Treatment for non-emergency conditions, or for hospital admissions resulting from emergencies, is normally free for people holding a European Health Insurance card (EHIC) issued by most European governments, or certain other countries listed here. In the absence of such a card you would be well advised to get private travel health insurance.</p>
<p>At large organised events, and in many theatre productions, basic medical assistance and first aid is provided through the support of organisations such as St John Ambulance or the stewards for the event.</p>
<p>Pharmacies (often referred to as "chemists") are found across London, with chains such as Lloyds Pharmacy and Boots being prevalent. Many independent pharmacies also exist. Most large supermarkets also have pharmacy counters, although these do not stock some of the stronger remedies. Unlike other European countries pharmacies in the UK are not often marked by prominent neon "green cross" signs.</p>
<p>Pharmacists are also able to offer advice on many health problems and recommend medicines that might help. For certain remedies (for example stronger painkillers) you may have to ask at the counter, as for regulatory reasons these can only be sold by pharmacists under strict protocols. Don't be alarmed if the pharmacist asks some basic diagnostic questions or for your ID.</p>
<p>Need to spend a penny? Some businesses allow people to use their facilities without purchasing anything, others reserve them for customers only. The Great British Public Toilet Map attempts to map publicly-accessible toilets and baby changing facilities.</p>
<p>All the main London rail terminals now have free toilets, although cleanliness can vary. Transport for London have produced a map of stations on their network with a toilet. Where a pictogram is black, this indicates that lavatories are outside the gateline (thus open to all), while red pictograms mark toilets which are inside the gateline so only accessible to passengers or those willing to pay to touch in and out. Finally, the presence of an asterisk tells you whether a fee is charged for use of the facilities.</p>

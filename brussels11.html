The nearby cemetery is home to many silent witnesses of the so called military victories. The railway museum Train World and nearby Tram Museum in the Woluwe district are top attractions for rail enthusiasts. Woluwe also has a lot to offer to architecture lovers, with the 50.835144.416258 Stoclet Palace  and Solvay Residence recognized as  UNESCO World Heritage Sites.</p>
<p>When strolling along architectural sights and museum display cases feels overwhelming, the Sonian Forest to the south of the city will offer a welcomed change of scenery. This vast section of nature, with lakes and century old beech trees, is protected as  UNESCO World Heritage Site and a true heaven for fans of outdoor activities.</p>
<p>If you're planning on visiting many attractions and museums, consider the advance purchase of a Brussels Card[dead link], which offers discounts at many attractions and free entrance to 40 of the most popular museums. It is available in 24 hr (€24), 48 hr (€36) and 72 hr (€42) versions, includes a free guidebook, free use of public transit (metro, bus, tram), and discounts at various shops and restaurants. It may not be worth it to those who already receive discounts (children, students, etc.). The card can be purchased on-line in advance for a discount, at the major tourist offices, and in some museums. Keep in mind however that many attractions have severely limited opening hours (usually from 09:00 until 17:00) when planning your visit, although sights like the Grand Place or Atomium can be enjoyed around the clock.</p>
<p>Brussels has a large variety of activities to offer, regardless of the weather. Strolling through the medieval centre and enjoying waffles or fries on the go is a favorite for locals and tourists. When passing the 50.847954.350411 Stock Exchange, sit down on the stairs along with the locals and have a chat. Keep an eye out for comic book murals, of which there are 43 different ones to discover around the city! Those fascinated by comic books may consider visiting the Museum of Figurines or the Marc Sleen Museum. Brussels can also be explored from underground through the  Sewer Museum, learning the history of the city while walking underneath its busy traffic.</p>
<p>When weather permits, a walk through the 50.8069444.3777782 Ter Kameren Park  or even the Sonian Forest, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site, is highly recommended. The 50.8405564.3927783 Centenary Park  is closer to the city centre, and climbing the countless steps towards the top of its arc (entrance through the Museum of Military History) is worth the effort for a fantastic view over the European Quarter of the city. A less physically intense alternative to exploring the monuments of Brussels is a visit to 50.894174.338614 Mini Europe  on the Heysel plateau to the north, a park with scale models of numerous iconic European buildings and features. In summer, a zip line ride down from the top of the Atomium is an unforgettable experience for die hard thrill seekers!</p>

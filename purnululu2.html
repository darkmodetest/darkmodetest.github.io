Some of the plants here don't even have names yet, as they were so recently discovered. The fan palm (Livistona victoriae) is particularly eye-catching; it clings to walls and crevices in dangerously steep places, especially in the northwest. Some stand over 12 m high, while Mini Palms is a gorge carpeted with miniature specimens. Trees that cling to rocks with their roots include the rock fig, the milkwood tree and the dwarf tropical red box gum.</p>
<p>The park spans a boundary between tropical and arid zones, so species from both coexist: for instance the flat-toed kangaroo is tropical, the mountain kangaroo comes from stony dry climes, and the brown snake is adapted to both habitats. There are some 150 bird species, some distinctive such as spinifex pigeons and brightly coloured budgerigars. Others such as the nocturnal swallowtail, white-tipped pigeon, and brown-breasted fathead are well camouflaged against the rocks.</p>
<p>Kimberley has a monsoon climate, and the park is reliably accessible in the dry season May-Oct. Days average 30°C, dropping to 15°C at night. The park may be accessible April, Nov and Dec, depending on the rains. Once these set in, the swollen creeks make the tracks and hiking trails impassable, and the park closes.</p>
<p>-17.4208128.29911 Purnululu Visitor Centre, ☏ +61 8 9168 7300. Apr-Oct 8AM-noon, 1-4PM. Has information on the park and issues trail maps. It also sells cold drinks, ice, snacks and souvenirs. (updated Aug 2024)</p>

<p>Spring Creek Track branches off Great Northern Highway 250 km south of Kununurra. The unsealed, ungraded track is 53 km / 33 miles long and is only passable in the dry season by high-clearance 4WD vehicles. This brings you to the Ranger Station / Visitor Centre, reckon 3 hours, and you pay admission there. It's another 12 km to accommodation and an hour or two more to the main sights. Leave caravans in the rest area by the highway turnoff. </p>
<p>A day trip is just about possible but the park advise against. You'd finish by watching the sunset from the lookout then have to negotiate the return track for 3 hours in darkness to Spring Creek rest area.</p>
<p>There is no air service to the park. Fixed-wing aircraft make non-landing tours from Kununurra. Helicopter tours fly from Bellburn airstrip within the park; they no longer fly from Warmun.</p>
<p>Purnululu charges the same standard fee as other national parks, see the WA parks website and Western Australia#See.</p>
<p>You may not bring dogs or other animals into the park.</p>
<p>As with the access track, you need high clearance 4WD to reach the sights and trailheads.</p>
<p>The only shop of any kind in the park is at the visitor centre.</p>
<p>You're safe enough on the marked trails, bring plenty of water. The park may close for safety if the temperature soars much over 40°C or if wildfires break out.</p>
<p>As of Aug 2024, the park has a patchy signal from Optus, and the two lodges have Wifi. There's no signal on the access track.</p>

<p>Perth is the capital and largest city of Western Australia. It is separated from Adelaide (the nearest city with over 100,000 inhabitants) by a distance of 2,120 km, including the vast spaces of the Nullarbor Plain, making it one of the world's most isolated cities.</p>
<p>Perth spreads out along on a flat coastal plain, dissected by the Swan River, and spreads over the Darling Scarp to the east. The Indian Ocean coastline to the west is its only distinct physical boundary making it the most isolated continental city anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Perth has a population of 2.3 million (2023), making it the fourth largest city in Australia.</p>
<p>The official "City of Perth" is a small area on the north side of the Swan River, consisting of just the city centre. However, the Perth metropolitan area is much larger, spreading in all directions other than the ocean.</p>
<p>The Perth region has been home to the Indigenous Nyoongar people for at least the past 60,000 years.</p>
<p>British settlers established a free settler colony in 1829 as part of the Swan River Colony. The settlement was given the name "Perth" after the city of Perth, Scotland, the hometown of Sir George Murray, the British Colonial Secretary at that time.</p>
<p>Lack of labour hampered its development until 1850, when convicts were brought in, at a time when transportation to other parts of Australia had ceased. This boosted the size of the colony and their labour helped shape the early architecture of the city, as well as other infrastructure. The discovery of gold in the 1890s triggered a boom which, with subsequent mineral discoveries, has been a major part of the state's economy. Western Australia joined the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, after which Perth became a state capital.</p>
<p>Once a small, isolated city, Perth's population overtook that of Adelaide in the 1980s. Perth remains one of Australia's fastest growing cities, and has been transformed from a relatively laid back city to a vibrant one.</p>
<p>Perth's population has been growing more rapidly since the beginning of the 21st century. The development hasn't taken away completely the older parts of the city, and there are many parks and other green spaces within close proximity of the CBD. Perth's economy is intimately tied with the mining industry, and its skyline is fittingly dominated by the corporate offices of Australia's two largest mining conglomerates Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton. A large proportion of Perth's residents comprise of miners, who are transported to the mines in the vast interior of Western Australia via private "Fly-in Fly-out" services operated by the mining companies.</p>
<p>Despite its isolation, Perth is a surprisingly culturally diverse city. Due to the high rate of migration to Perth, slightly less than half of Perth's residents were born outside Australia. Its relative proximity to Southeast Asia and Africa has led to an influx of migrants from countries such as Malaysia, South Africa and Thailand, and this is reflected in the diversity of cuisine available in Perth. If you wish to experience a cosmopolitan culture without the hustle and bustle of larger cities, perhaps Perth would be your cup of tea.</p>

The Tuolumne River meanders across the meadow while rugged mountain peaks and glacially carved domes surround it. During the brief snow-free summer season the meadow is the site of a massive wildflower bloom, making this an excellent area for day hikes and photography.</p>
<p>Crane Flat is a pleasant forest and meadow area 16 mi (26 km) (30 minutes) from Yosemite Valley. Crane Flat is accessible by car all year. Bears can be spotted in the meadows in this area regularly, so keep your eyes open and don't block traffic if you see one!</p>
<p>The Tuolumne Grove has about two dozen mature giant sequoias and is on the Tioga Road just east of Crane Flat. Sequoias are only visible after a 1 mi (1.6 km) hike with 500 ft (150 m) of elevation loss. (The 1 mi (1.6 km) hike back to the parking lot gains 500 ft (150 m) and is strenuous.) The drive takes about 1½ hours from South Entrance. Parking is limited.</p>
<p>The Merced Grove is on the Big Oak Flat Road east of Big Oak Flat Entrance and is home to about two dozen mature giant sequoias. Sequoias are only visible after a 1½-mile hike with 500 ft (150 m) of elevation loss. (The 1½-mile hike back to the parking lot gains 500 ft (150 m) and is strenuous.) The drive takes about 1½ hours from South Entrance. Parking is extremely limited.</p>
<p>Until the completion of the O'Shaughnessy Dam in 1923, the Hetch Hetchy Valley was said to rival Yosemite Valley for beauty. The fight over the dam was a bitter battle between environmentalists including John Muir and the city of San Francisco, and efforts are still ongoing to remove the dam and restore the valley, though restoration of the habitat would likely take decades or more after the dam's removal. Today, the dam is used to deliver water from the Tuolumne River 167 mi (269 km) west to San Francisco. Even though Hetch Hetchy Valley is flooded, it is still home to spectacular scenery and is the starting point for many less-used wilderness trails. Although the road to Hetch Hetchy is open year-round, on a day-to-day basis it has restricted hours due to security for the reservoir. It may close periodically due to snow in winter and spring. Swimming and boating are not allowed in the reservoir.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne lies upstream from Hetch Hetchy and is accessible to hikers. Hikers can also visit two of North America's largest waterfalls in the Hetch Hetchy Valley: Wapama Falls, at 1,700 ft (520 m), and Tueeulala Falls, at 840 ft (260 m).</p>
<p>Yosemite is one of the world's most spectacular hiking destinations, and all visitors should consider at least a short hike. The Vernal Fall trail is a short and rewarding trek for valley visitors, numerous trails in the high country along Route 120 are suitable for brief trips to see alpine lakes or granite domes, and the sequoia groves all offer the option of short hikes that can easily be extended. More adventurous and physically-fit hikers might consider the Half Dome trail or any of the park's backcountry trails. Prior to hiking check with rangers for trail conditions; snow and hazards from falling rock close many trails in winter, and the cables on the Half Dome trail are only up from late May through early October (ascending Half Dome when the cables are not erected is possible but is dangerous and strongly discouraged). No permits are required park-wide for day hikes, with the exception of the Half Dome Summit.</p>

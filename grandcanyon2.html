The desert environment and a lack of herbaceous ground cover reveal a geologic story that is unparalleled.  Surprisingly, the rock layers displayed at Grand Canyon show little sign of wear.  The layers have been preserved almost perfectly, as though they were layers in a cake.  Nowhere else on Earth displays so many volumes of the planet's history in such pristine condition.</p>
<p>The resulting landscape provides visitors with some of the most magnificent and unsurpassed vistas on the planet.</p>
<p>The most famous animal in the park may be the rare California Condor. They can occasionally be seen flying near Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim.  Common bird life includes Canyon Wrens, Stellar's Jays (with their peaked caps), swallows, hummingbirds, and the playful and entertaining raven.</p>
<p>Mule deer are common.  Some of the largest elk in North America can be found in the national park, and in the adjacent Kaibab National Forest. Desert bighorn sheep are also seen on occasion, mainly in the inner canyon.</p>
<p>You'll often spot coyotes no matter where you are in the park, and if you're lucky, you'll get to hear them sing.  Other predators are cougars (aka mountain lions and many other names) and bobcats.  Black bears are rare, and they generally stay away from the inhabited areas.</p>
<p>Some of the smaller creatures that can be found in the inhabited areas of the park are the ringtail (called a cat, but not in the cat family), which like to live in the rafters of some of the historic buildings on the rim.  They are quick and stealthy, but they often forget how visible that tail is, and you'll see it hanging out over a  beam.</p>
<p>A favorite with visitors is the Abert's squirrel with their tufted ears.  Other varieties of squirrels and chipmunks are also popular. They seem tame and like to beg for food behind the Bright Angel Lodge, near the Ice Cream fountain.  But heed the warnings and resist the urge.  One of the most common injuries in the park are squirrel bites.</p>
<p>You might also see the common striped skunk, and if lucky, you might even see the rarer western spotted skunk (usually at lower elevations).  Skunks here are also habituated to humans and may seem tame, but they will react as all skunks do, so don't come up on them suddenly!</p>
<p>For the reptile family, there are variety of small lizards, and a few snakes. The most striking (in more ways than one) is the Grand Canyon rattlesnake; with its reddish (almost pink) coloring it neatly blends into the rocky terrain of the canyon. They are interesting to see as long as it is at a safe distance.  Rattlesnakes are more afraid of you than you are of them. If given the chance, they will avoid any contact with humans. Most rattlesnake victims are young males that are chasing or trying to capture a snake.</p>

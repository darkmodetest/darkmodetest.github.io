The gardens represent most Australian climates from the rainforests of the north, to the deserts of the interior to the pines of Norfolk Island or pretty much any landscape in Australia.</p>
<p>From the botanic gardens, you can drive to the top where the Black Mountain Nature Reserve is, but it's much better to walk there. There is a good trail that starts at the Botanical Gardens, which too is a good place to experience the bush in the bush capital. </p>
<p>Another park that is important but doesn't have much greenery and bush in it is Commonwealth Park between the city and Lake Burley Griffin; this park was designed by famed landscape designer Dame Sylvia Crowe in 1964. Here you can find the sculptures, ponds and walkways, and an open-air theatre. On the hill there is an exhibition of Canberra's creation.</p>
<p>A bit to the west is Weston Park which is very popular with residents of Canberra, where there are good places to have a picnic, a small train and a maze. Somewhat hidden, there is an English garden, a cafc, a small art gallery and an abandoned arboretum near the nurseries.</p>
<p>Most of the other nature reserves are located in the countryside. Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve is one not far from Canberra, and was destroyed by a bushfire in 2003, but nature is stubborn and, despite everything, it is still a good reserve to experience the Australian bush and animals.</p>
<p>Namadgi National Park is the largest and the only national park in the ACT, taking up half the territory, there are plenty of opportunities to hike or camp in this beautiful national park.</p>

<p>As the development of Canberra didn't take off until the 1950s, the city has few noteworthy historic buildings. In addition to those which host major national institutions described elsewhere, there are some buildings are considered historically significant. As Canberra was just a farming area, to grip a better understanding of the area, Blundell's Cottage or Calthorpe's House are historic cottages of some of the earliest settlers of the area and picture the early days of the territory. </p>
<p>Other interesting historic buildings include the Sydney and Melbourne buildings in Civic and were the first commercially-funded buildings in Canberra, and have been important local landmarks since the 1920s and both surrounded by loggias modelled on those of buildings in Florence, Italy. They are occupied by a mix of restaurants (most of which are quite good), nightclubs, pubs and small businesses.</p>
<p>For a bit of military tourism, the Royal Military College - Duntroon was a training college established in 1911 making it one of the oldest institutions in Canberra. It includes a chapel built by Australian prisoners of war being held in harsh conditions at Changi in Singapore during the Second World War has also been relocated to here, and is located halfway along Miles Road.</p>
<p>And for a church, many don't associate Canberra with one, but St John the Baptist Church was consecrated in 1845 and this Anglican church is the oldest church in Canberra and pre-dates the establishment of the city by almost 70 years! It has a small museum too.</p>

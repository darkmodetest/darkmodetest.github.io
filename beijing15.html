The National Stadium (commonly known as the Bird's Nest) stands as an enduring symbol of the 2008 Olympic Games. Nearby, the striking CCTV Headquarters has become an icon of contemporary Beijing, surrounded by the city's skyline, which includes supertall structures like the China World Trade Center Tower 3, Tower 3B, and the China Zun.</p>
<p>The National Centre for the Performing Arts in Xicheng District offers a variety of performances including opera, music, and theatre. Even if you don't attend a performance, the egg shaped building itself is worth a visit. The exterior is made from a steel oval structure that includes over 18,000 titanium plates and 1,000 sheets of ultra-white glass.</p>
<p>The Beijing Opera is considered the most famous of all the traditional opera performed around China. This kind of opera is nothing like western opera with costumes, singing style, music and spectator reactions being distinctly Chinese. The plot is usually quite simple, so you might be able to understand some of what happens even if you do not understand the language. Some of the best places to watch Beijing Opera are found in Xicheng District including Huguang Huguang Theatre and Lao She Teahouse. There are also a number in Dongcheng District including Chang'an Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>Acrobatics shows are also worth a visit if you want to see some traditional Chinese entertainment. Some of the best shows are found in Tianqiao Acrobatics Theatre in Xicheng District and in Chaoyang Theatre in Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>Drama plays have had a slow start in Beijing and are still not as widespread as you might expect for a city like Beijing, and you will most likely not be able to find many Western plays. However, some good places for contemporary Chinese plays do exist including Capital Theatre in Dongcheng District and Century Theater in Chaoyang District.</p>
<p>Classical music has got a much stronger foothold in Beijing than drama plays. Some of the best places to go are the National Centre for the Performing Arts and the Century Theater both mentioned above as well as Beijing Concert Hall in Xicheng District.</p>
<p>Beijing offers many schools that provide Mandarin lessons for foreigners:</p>
<p>Beijing is an excellent destination for gourmet tours and exploring the culture and traditions through food. Not only can you enjoy the rich flavors of Chinese cuisine, but you also have the opportunity to acquire new culinary skills, bringing home a piece of Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Beijing is the main centre of higher learning in China. Peking and Tsinghua Universities are the most prestigious universities in China, and also ranked among the best in the world. They attract top students from across China and globally as well. Most of the universities are clustered in Haidian District in the northwestern part of the city and nearly all of the universities in Beijing accept foreign students. </p>
<p>Beijing is a major hub for business and technology companies. The Central Business District (CBD) around Guomao and Wangjing, both in the Chaoyang District are popular office areas for international business. Haidian District is home to many of China's largest tech companies, and Financial Street in Xicheng District houses major banks and insurance companies. The Lize Financial Business District in Fengtai District, anchored by the Leeza SOHO tower with its curvy design, was launched just before the pandemic and is set to have a direct subway connection to Daxing Airport by 2025.</p>

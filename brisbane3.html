Brisbane does not experience the distinct "four seasons" like the other Australian capital cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. When winter arrives towards the southern capital cities, temperatures are sent into the low tens (°C), while Brisbane's climate stays mostly dry and sunny, with daytime temperatures usually remaining above 20°C.</p>
<p>More detailed information on Brisbane climate and weather is available online at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.</p>
<p>Sunburn is a risk in this part of the world; see our Sunburn and sun protection article and #Sun safety below.</p>
<p>Brisbane can be accessed by plane via the main Brisbane Airport (BNE IATA), or by the less convenient but often cheaper Gold Coast Airport.</p>
<p>Brisbane Airport has direct flights from all Australian capitals and many Queensland centres. Major domestic carriers include Virgin Australia, Jetstar, and Qantas. The airport is serviced by many regional airlines and it is possible to fly daily to most Asian centres (and on to Europe), the United States and New Zealand, without flying via Sydney or Melbourne.</p>
<p>You can get a bus and train from the Gold Coast Airport to Brisbane, by using the Surfside buses to Robina and transferring to the train.  A single fare costs around $17, and you can buy a single ticket or use a Go Card.</p>
<p>Both airports have a full range of rental car options.</p>
<p>Long distance rail services both arrive and depart from -27.4648153.01931 Roma Street Station in the inner city. Services to New South Wales operated by NSW TrainLink depart from Platform 2 and all other Long Distance Services depart from Platform 10.</p>
<p>Visitors from southern states can reach Brisbane by either the New England and Cunningham or Pacific Highways.</p>
<p>Most long distance bus services operate from level 3 of the -27.4663153.01862 Brisbane Transit Centre near Roma Street Station in the inner city.</p>
<p>Brisbane has an international cruise terminal next to -27.4411153.069463 Portside Wharf.</p>

<p>Translink is responsible for all trains, buses, ferries and trams in South East Queensland and regional urban buses. The website and app can be used to plan a journey, including full navigation and real time updates. Apple Maps and Google Maps provide a similar experience.</p>
<p>A 50-cent flat fare applies to any journey, regardless of mode, distance or transfers. The only exception is an Airtrain journey to or from Brisbane Airport which costs $21.90. Refer to the website for discounted fares.</p>
<p>A contactless credit or debit card, go card, or paper ticket is required to travel.</p>
<p>A Visa, Mastercard or American Express is accepted, including those in a digital wallet like Apple Pay or Google Pay. Your fare is deducted from your card as you touch on and touch off each mode of transport. Trains and trams have fare gates or distinctive pink validators to touch before you board and after you alight. Buses and ferries have validators to touch as you board and alight. A failure to touch off each mode of transport will result in a fixed fare of $2.50 being charged. You can be fined $261 for travelling without a valid fare.</p>

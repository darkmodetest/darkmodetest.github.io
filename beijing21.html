People honk all the time. Honking is not usually considered rude. It is simply another way to indicate that the driver is there. Be prepared for drivers to violate traffic laws even to the extent of going in reverse on highways to back up to a missed exit or driving on a sidewalk. Also expect occasional road debris (a piece of wood or torn out tire) to be laying in the roadway. Pedestrians should be very careful crossing the street: People will generally stop for you, but they will honk. Keep an eye on the locals and cross with them — there is strength in numbers. Cars don't need to stop at a red light when they are turning right. Although the traffic law gives the first priority to pedestrians, not every driver obeys the rule.</p>
<p>Tap water in Beijing is not safe for drinking. Hygiene for cooked food is generally not an issue. Chinese people place a lot of emphasis on the freshness of their food, so any food you eat is usually cooked to order. However, be wary if you plan to eat cold or raw dishes.</p>
<p>A white surgical face mask may help with the occasional dust storms, but a simple fabric or paper mask will not protect you against smaller airborne particles. Most smog or haze outbreaks are made up of fine particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller (PM2.5). N95 or KN95 masks provide good protection against smog as they are at least 95% efficient against fine particles that are about 0.1 – 0.3 microns.</p>
<p>Air pollution and smog has traditionally been a big problem in Beijing like any other big city in China. Coal burning and industrial emissions in the surrounding region makes for very unhealthy air. Since 2018 air quality has significantly improved. It's a good idea to check the air-quality readings online first thing every morning. Hazardous air may continue for several days before precipitation or a gust of wind clears the air. Readings of air quality updated by the hour for Beijing and other Chinese cities can be found at aqicn.org. If it is "unhealthy" or "hazardous", consider cutting back on your activities if they are likely to involve a lot of walking outside, in favor of visits to museums or shops.</p>
<p>Chinese public hospitals are generally not recommended for travelers due to the lack of English-speaking staff. For those seeking medical assistance in Beijing, the following hospitals are recommended as they offer services in English. Raffles Medical Beijing and Beijing United Family Hospital are expensive private facilities with English-speaking doctors. Public hospitals with good language resources include Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Beijing Sino-Japanese Friendship Hospital. The four hospitals are listed on the Australian Embassy website for travelers (https://china.embassy.gov.au/bjng/HOSPITALLIST.html).</p>
<p>For dental care in central Beijing, you can visit the Peking University Hospital of Stomatology 5th Outpatient Department (北大口腔第五门诊部). The clinic follows an efficient process. Unlike some places where dentists may try to upsell by identifying unnecessary issues, you won’t encounter that here. They charge 468 yuan for a cleaning. It's recommended to book an appointment through their app for convenience with a small additional fee of 20 yuan.</p>

<p>Canberra was built to be the capital city of Australia, taking up all of Australian Capital Territory surrounded by the southeast of New South Wales. A planned city with national monuments, museums, and galleries all built around large man-made lakes. The bush capital - Canberra is also a great place to enjoy the outdoors, with excellent cycling, gardens, parks, bushwalking and nature reserves.</p>

<p>Country ACT is also home to Namadgi National Park, the Australian Capital Territory's only national park, taking up around a good forty-seven percent of the ACT's land area. Being the northernmost of all the heritage listed Australian Alps National Parks the park enjoys a good array of snow. The park also has plenty of MTB trails. </p>

<p>The requirement for an Australian capital city to be built was specified in the Australian constitution at federation in 1901, and seven years later the site for what would become Canberra was established.  A design competition was held for the city in 1911 which was won by Chicago-based architect Walter Burley Griffin in 1912. The name "Canberra" was made official in 1913. However, much of Griffin's plan was not implemented during his lifetime in part due to the Great War, the Great Depression and conflict between Griffin and the commission tasked with implementing his ideas. To give just two examples, Lake Burley Griffin was part of his original design but only implemented in the 1960s, almost three decades after his death and the light rail system Griffin originally envisioned took over a century to see even the first line enter service.</p>
<p>The Australian Capital Territory was created from land inside New South Wales, and originally governed directly by the federal government. In 1988 the federal government granted the area "responsible government" (aka "home rule") and the first local elections were held in 1989 with parties opposed to the very idea of a local government for the Capital Territory garnering significant support. Politically the local Legislative Assembly has often been a "hung parliament" with neither right wing Liberals nor left wing Labor able to govern on their own, but the office of Chief Minister has mostly been held by the Labor Party.</p>
<p>Canberra is a highly planned city, its primary design conceived by the American architect Walter Burley Griffin, built on the shores of a man-made lake (Lake Burley Griffin). Populated at first largely by politicians and public servants, it has taken time to develop its own identity and culture. Extensive building of national facilities and museums has made it a unique destination.</p>
<p>The planned creation of this new city was not without critics - cynics having said it was a "waste of a good sheep pasture". Not unlike Brasilia or other "planned capitals", Canberra's design has often clashed with the needs of its actual inhabitants and the somewhat awkward location chosen as a political compromise (and to develop the interior) has put it slightly off the beaten tourist path.</p>
<p>Lake Burley Griffin divides central Canberra.  The central shopping and commercial area, known as "Civic", is on the north side and the parliamentary triangle and embassy area are on the south side. National institutions are likewise divided, examples being the National Museum of Australia and the Australian War Memorial on the north side and the National Library and National Gallery of Australia on the south side.</p>

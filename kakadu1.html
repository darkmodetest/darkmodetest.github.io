<p>A trip to the north of Australia is never complete without visiting Kakadu National Park. Sometimes colloquially called as "Australia's national park", the park is in the Northern Territory, 171 km east of Darwin and the national park is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list. The park is one of the few listed spots both natural and cultural listed, one of only four in Australia and one of 39 anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Kakadu is two very different parks, which depend based on season. During the dry season, the park's known for its many rock art, hiking trails and waterfalls are accessible, but during the wet season, the crocodiles and seeing the park via a private plane provide views of waterfalls you've probably never imagined.</p>
<p>The origins of the name "Kakadu" comes from Gagudju, an Aboriginal floodplain language which was one of the languages spoken in the north of the park at the beginning of the 20th century. Gagudju is no longer regularly spoken day-to-day but descendants of this language group are still living in Kakadu.</p>
<p>Kakadu National Park and Arnhem Land comprise more than 110,000 km2 (42,000 sq mi) in the northeast corner of the Northern Territory. The landscapes are diverse and set the scene for outback adventure travel, Aboriginal culture and nature activities.</p>
<p>Kakadu National Park is the second largest national park in Australia only behind Munga-Thirri–Simpson Desert National Park in South Australia. It contains one of the highest concentrated areas of Aboriginal rock art sites in the world; the most famous examples are at Nourlangie Rock and Ubirr.</p>
<p>The secret to discovering Kakadu is taking your time. You'll find stories, secrets and sights never imagined. It is impossible to appreciate the full breadth and beauty of the park in a fleeting visit – if you can afford the time, spend a week or more.</p>
<p>Nature and wildlife abound in this area, which is known for its level of biodiversity. Wholly Aboriginal owned land, Arnhem Land is known for its strong Aboriginal culture, towering escarpments, wild coastline, savannah woodlands, lush wetlands and prolific wildlife. Closer to Darwin is the Mary River region, home to millions of birds, saltwater crocodiles and fish, including the mighty barramundi, which makes it a fishing hot spot.</p>
<p>The park was established in 1981.  It is governed by Environment Australia/Parks Australia and Aboriginal traditional land owners (the Gun-djeihmi, Kunwinjku, Krakeourtinnie and Jawoyn peoples).</p>
<p>The park contains 1,980,400 hectares of wetlands and other terrain. It is Australia's second largest National Park and is approximately the size of Israel or Wales.</p>
<p>Kakadu is home to 68 mammals (almost one-fifth of Australia’s mammals), more than 120 reptiles, 26 frogs, over 300 tidal and freshwater fish species, more than 2 000 plants and over 10 000 species of insects. It provides habitat for more than 290 bird species (over one-third of Australia’s birds). Its internationally important wetlands are a major staging point for migratory birds. Some of these species are threatened or endangered. Many are found nowhere else in the world and there are still others yet to be discovered. The Creation Ancestors gave Bininj/Mungguy a kinship system linking people to all things and the cultural responsibility to look after them all. They have always understood the biodiversity of country and their traditional ancestral knowledge is a vital part of managing Kakadu’s rich environment.</p>

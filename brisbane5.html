This particular service is free but often crowded as a result.</p>
<p>Taxis are numerous throughout Brisbane and can take you anywhere. All cabs can be hailed down no matter where you are, provided their roof light is on, though in some areas they might not be able to stop, so it might be best to book one in advance. All cabs accept cash, credit and debit cards. Despite cabs being fitted with GPS units, you'll find it wise to check with the driver about your destination before departing and make sure they are willing to go there.</p>
<p>In the outer-suburban areas, cabs will pull over if you hail them down from the side of the road and can be found in designated taxi ranks in shopping centres, or near bars and pubs. The same can be said for the inner-city, however taxi ranks are more common and it's usually best to catch a cab from there. At night though, especially on Friday and Saturday, taxis exclusively pick up passengers from these ranks and you'd be extremely lucky if you get one elsewhere. These ranks are usually monitored by security and have ushers at night. From midnight-5:30AM on Friday and Saturday nights, all taxis from the CBD and Fortitude Valley become "FlatFare", meaning that there is a fixed price for any given destination and you will have to pay before entering the taxi.</p>
<p>Taxis can be expensive in Brisbane; a trip between the airport and the city can be in excess of $50–60 and can easily run to over $100 if you go beyond the metropolitan Brisbane region.</p>
<p>Uber, Ola and DiDi are available.</p>
<p>There are plenty of national car rental companies available to pick up from the airport. As is common with many hire car companies, you will often pay a premium to pick up or return at the airport location. If you are looking to cover a long distance by car, ensure your rental policy includes unlimited mileage – most economy to standard sized car rental include this already. Most car rental companies hire to people 25 years of age and over, some all age car rental companies do hire to younger drivers over 18 years of age (there are surcharges involved for under-age drivers).</p>
<p>Many of the roads in the CBD are one-way, making driving in this area complicated for people not familiar with the layout.  Drivers used to city driving should not find Brisbane too much of a challenge, and parking is readily available in parking stations in the city, albeit often at a steep cost, around $40 to casually park for a day. $15 parking is generally available with early-bird deals (arrive before 9:00, leave after 16:00.) The CBD has limited street parking and issues parking infringements for illegally parked vehicles. All inner-city street parking is metered and signed and costs about $4 per hour. Avoid parking fines by only parking in designated parking bays marked by white lines. A yellow painted line along the kerbside indicates no standing and no parking.</p>

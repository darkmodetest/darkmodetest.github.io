The system covers all train, metro, bus, ferry and light rail services in Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong and the surrounding regions. There are three ways to pay for your journey:</p>
<p>To use an Opal card or contactless card, simply hold the card up to a reader to tap-on at the start of your trip, and tap-off at the end. This applies to all transport except for the Manly ferry, when you only need to tap-on. You must tap on before you board trains, light rail and ferries. For buses, the readers are located by the entry and exit doors of the bus. Not all wharves and stations have ticket barriers, so you'll need to remember to tap on or off at the readers or you'll be charged the maximum fare for your route. The readers on buses activate as you are approaching the stop, or soon after the bus has halted. You can check how much credit is remaining on your card every time you tap on or off, just look at the screens attached to the ticket barriers or readers. If you're using a contactless card you can check your fares online the following day.</p>
<p>Daily fares are capped at $17.80 from Monday to Thursdays and $8.90 on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. There is no need to worry about zone boundaries or having the right ticket because the system will automatically calculate the fare for each trip. Other benefits include weekly caps, and off-peak discounts for trains (on weekends and after 10AM and before 3PM weekdays). There are no off-peak fares for buses or ferries, and this can make train journeys cheaper than the bus off-peak. After making eight 'journeys' during a week (the Opal week runs from Monday to Sunday), all subsequent travel is half-price for the rest of the week. Any trip made within 1 hour of the previous trip is considered a continuation of a journey. No matter how much you travel, Opal card users will never be charged more than $50 in any Monday to Sunday week (not including the Airport Station access fees, and other OpalPay services). If you change modes of transport during your journey (e.g. from bus to train) the system will provide a $2 discount on the fare of the second and subsequent trips. Children aged 15 years and under are entitled to a discount on most public transport. Children 3 years and under travel free.</p>
<p>Sydney has a vast suburban rail network operated by Sydney Trains, covering 882 km of track and 176 stations. The train network will take passengers to most of the metropolitan area. Trains service every station in the metropolitan area at least every 30 minutes. Frequency is higher in the city, and major centres (Chatswood, Parramatta, Bondi Junction, the Airport, etc) usually see a train every 10 minutes or so. Peak times (7-9:30AM and 4:30-7PM) have more frequent and also crowded trains, as well as some express services that skip more stations. Expect congestion around Central and Town Hall.</p>

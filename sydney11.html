Drivers will usually take the toll roads unless you ask them not to, and with some tolls approaching $10 a pop, this can get expensive fast.  Tolls are added automatically by the meter as incurred during the journey.</p>
<p>Taxis accept all major credit cards, although credit card terminals are improbably often "broken".  They charge an extra 5% on top of the fare for this. Many of the taxi companies have their own apps.  Tipping is not required or generally expected. However, rounding up a taxi fare to the next dollar (or five or ten dollars, depending on the base fare) is fairly common. On the other hand, if the driver rounds the fare down to the nearest dollar, accept with grace.</p>
<p>If you need a child seat, a wheelchair taxi or are traveling with a large group, you can call ahead for maxicab, which can fit up to 10 people.  The airport has a maxicab rank.</p>
<p>Scams such as taxi drivers refusing fares, deliberately not using a meter or overcharging is illegal but rife and scams are known to affect both local Sydneysiders and visitors. If you have been scammed, immediately file a report at pointtopoint.nsw.gov.au or contact ‚òè 131 727 (domestic). It's likely you will get a portion of your fare refunded. Make sure you take as many photos documenting your experience if it is safe to do so; also try to get the taxi driver's ID and license plate if possible.</p>
<p>Uber and Didi offer a convenient alternative to taxis (Lyft isn't available in Sydney), and considerable cost savings when there is no surge, with Uber somewhat more expensive than its competitors. Ubers will nearly always take the fastest route (including tolls when necessary) unless you tell them to take another way. They are every bit as common as taxis in the city and most suburbs, and for most travelers, there's little if any reason to ever take a taxi; the main exception is if you have children under 7, who cannot legally ride without a child seat (which rideshare companies rarely if ever offer).  Rideshare drivers also cannot legally use bus lanes, while taxis can.</p>
<p>If you are spending time in the CBD, and visiting near-by attractions like Manly, Bondi (and the Eastern suburbs), Pyrmont or the Inner West, then a car may be more hassle than it's worth, with congestion, complex one-way schemes, and expensive and time-restricted parking. However if you are keen to explore the northern beaches, outer suburbs or travel further afield, a car may be the best option for travelling. Check the daily distance allowances and any one-way charge that may apply when driving from less popular destinations to major cities. Cars may be rented at the airport and elsewhere from major rental companies or at smaller, cheaper companies.</p>
<p>Sydney traffic is always busy, but outside of peak weekday times travelling by car is usually at least as quick as any method of public transport. Congestion can be expected on roads to the city 6:30AM-9:30AM, and roads away from the city 4:30PM-6:30PM. Allow double the normal travel time during these periods - longer if you are using motorways. Congestion is considerably worse and longer in both directions during the Friday afternoon peak. Some roads experience congestion at other times and roads heading to shopping, sports, parks and beaches can be heavily congested on weekends also - particularly on Saturday mornings and Saturday evenings. Roads around Bondi Beach and the other eastern suburbs beaches experience gridlock on summer weekends, with buses often caught in the same traffic as cars. Travel times from the city centre to the Sydney outskirts can take around 45 minutes in good traffic.</p>

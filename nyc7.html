Operates trains throughout the United States.   (updated Dec 2020) Amtrak trains stop at 40.7515-73.99594 Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station (Amtrak code NYP), 351 West 31st Street (directly under Madison Square Garden, between 31st and 33rd St, and between 8th and 9th Ave).   (updated Oct 2023) Popular trains leaving during rush hours can fill up quickly; it is a good idea to make reservations online, or via phone, and pick up your ticket using a credit card or your confirmation number at one of the electronic kiosks throughout the station. On some of the non-business routes, for example New York to Montreal, Amtrak takes more time and costs more money than taking the bus or renting a car. Check and compare schedules and prices before booking.</p>
<p>Amtrak's routes stopping at Moynihan Train Hall at Penn Station include:</p>
<p>Service from California, Oregon or Washington states takes about 4 days and requires a change of train in Chicago.</p>
<p>Amtrak's ClubAcela Lounge, near the big security desk in Penn Station, offers complimentary drinks, wi-fi access, newspapers and magazines, and clean bathrooms. Access to the club is granted to travelers with sleeper tickets, First Class Acela tickets, or Amtrak GuestRewards SelectPlus membership.</p>
<p>New York City is served by three commuter railroads:</p>
<p>PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) is a subway system connecting New York City to Hoboken, Newark, and various points on the New Jersey shore of the Hudson River. Two lines pass under the Hudson and enter the city, one terminating near the World Trade Center site downtown, the other at 33rd Street in midtown (see map[dead link]). The PATH station at 33rd Street is not connected to, nor part of Penn Station.</p>
<p>PATH costs $2.75 per ride. PATH payment options:</p>
<p>TAPP and Smartlink are separate from the New York City OMNY payment system. PATH does not accept OMNY RFID cards, and PATH trips do not contribute to the OMNY weekly fare cap.</p>
<p>Some buses offer wi-fi, outlets and even business-class style luxury. Buses serve New Jersey, New York suburbs west of the Hudson River, and all cities along the east coast of the U.S.</p>
<p>New York City has always been one of the world's most important passenger sea ports, and arriving by ocean liner or cruise ship still remains an extraordinary and stylish method of arrival. In addition to passenger service from the Cunard Line, many cruise ships start or end their voyages in New York City.</p>
<p>While most people would advise against entering New York City by car (see the "Get around" section below), it is accessible by a number of highways:</p>
<p>From New Jersey there are three Hudson River crossings: The George Washington Bridge (on I-95, US 1 and US 9) in Fort Lee drops you off in Upper Manhattan, the Lincoln Tunnel (on NJ Route 495) in Weehawken will bring you to Midtown Manhattan, and the Holland Tunnel (on I-78) in Jersey City leaves you in lower Manhattan. Depending on where you are heading to in New York City and the time of day, you'll want to take advantage of the different crossings, but if you have the time and are looking for the most scenic of the three, take the George Washington Bridge's upper level for spectacular views of New York City; Hudson County, New Jersey; and the Hudson River. If you are heading to Staten Island, Queens or Brooklyn you can also take the Goethals Bridge (on I-278) in Elizabeth; the highway cuts across Staten Island and continues over the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge to Brooklyn. The other routes into Staten Island from NJ are the Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy, which puts you in Tottenville near the southern tip of the island, and the Bayonne Bridge, which leaves you in extreme northern Staten Island.</p>

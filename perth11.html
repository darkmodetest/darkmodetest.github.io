Bars usually become busy after 5PM with the afterwork crowd, but most locals tend to go to bars on Friday & Saturday nights. The CBD bars in particular get very busy on Friday nights with many of the popular bars forming long entry lines. Most bars open from around 11AM and close midnight (10PM on Sundays), a few bars do have special extended liquor trading hours to 1AM, 2AM, or 3AM. There has been an increase in small bars and bistro dining in niche areas of the CBD. However despite good quality, these are typically expensive, so browse around for a good value evening.</p>
<p>Perth has a small but strong dance music scene which revolves heavily around drum & bass. Club nights and international gigs are held at a variety of venues across the city centre, Northbridge and outer suburbs (check out local street press magazines such as Xpress for gig guides and further info) for a comprehensive gig guide).</p>
<p>Almost all clubs in Western Australia have very strict ID policies and it is highly unlikely that you will get in if you do not have your passport or an ID issued in Australia by a government agency (either an Australian driver's license or proof of age card) with you, even if you definitely look over the legal age. Also most dance music bars/clubs close at 2AM following Friday and Saturday nights and are subjected to Police enforced lockdowns and lockouts (as is the case in Brisbane), so you will find yourself stuck in one place after 3AM, and be stranded should you be short on money for a cab.</p>
<p>Most of Perth's hotels are concentrated in the city centre, the neighbouring suburb of East Perth (between the city centre and the Swan River), and the seaside suburb of Fremantle. Slightly further away, the coastal town of Mandurah, which is easily accessible by Perth's suburban railway system, is a popular weekend getaway for Perth's residents, and has several hotels and beach resorts to cater to that crowd.</p>
<p>Perth is very popular with backpackers, and there are a large number of backpackers' hostels located in the city, particularly in the Northbridge area. A few hostels in Perth are in terrible condition, so make sure to see your room or check the ratings online.</p>
<p>Caravan parks are a cost effective and often good value family way to stay in Perth. Caravan parks are usually some distance from the city, but some have bus stops right out the front door. Caravan parks are generally clean and offer a variety of accommodation types.</p>
<p>The main dangers that an overseas visitor to Perth faces are sunburn and dehydration. Make sure you cover yourself with SPF 30+ sunscreen and a hat, and preferably a shirt. In the warmer months, beware of dehydration in the hot weather, and keep a bottle of water with you. An insect repellent such as 'Aeroguard' will be useful on summer evenings if you are outdoors.</p>

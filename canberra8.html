Visitors can rent bicycles from several businesses, including Cycle Canberra. A single dockless bicycle sharing company, Airbike, operates in the area around Civic and the Parliamentary Triangle. There are also several bicycle shops along Lonsdale Street just north of Civic.</p>
<p>A full map of Canberra's cycle path network can be found on transport.act.gov.au[dead link]. OpenStreetMap shows cycle paths and water fountains. Some books which feature local rides are Cycling Around Canberra by Bruce Ashley, and Where To Ride Canberra by Bicycling Australia.</p>
<p>Canberra also has generally well developed on-road cycle facilities but the on-road cycle lanes sometimes end and start in utterly inexplicable places. Due to the popularity of cycling in Canberra, most road users are aware of cyclists and considerate of them. Like elsewhere in Australia, bike helmets are compulsory.</p>
<p>The attractions around the lake are accessible on fairly flat paths, and hilly segments are short. Attractions which involve “mountains” e.g. Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, the Arboretum or the Stromlo Observatory will obviously have steep access. However, travel from the Civic towards Belconnen or Canberra University is mainly uphill. Bicycles are permitted on footpaths in the ACT (except when passing shops during trading hours).</p>
<p>There are bike racks to lock your bike up at most shopping centres and points of interest. Bicycle cages along the cross-city bus routes can be used without additional charge. However, they are only available to registered MyWay card users, who have further applied for access to individual cages.</p>
<p>Most buses have front bike racks which can carry 2 bicycles at no additional cost. The bike racks have clips, so no additional equipment is necessary. Only 20" tyres or larger bikes are carried. Kids must be accompanied by adults, and child seats and other accessories must be removed from the bike.  You can take your bike on board Canberra's trams, or lock it at a tram station.</p>
<p>Canberra, as the national capital of Australia, contains a lot of government buildings, and many of them are often open for tours. By far the most significant one is Parliament House in Capital Hill, but other important buildings include the High Court of Australia, Old Parliament House, the Government House, the Royal Australian Mint and The Lodge, though not all of them are always open to the public. There are other buildings that are of national importance too, such as the National Library of Australia and the Australian War Memorial.</p>
<p>Most of the time, much of what to see in Canberra is located in South Canberra, or to be more specific, particularly more centred within Parliamentary Triangle which contains the High Court, National Archives, National Gallery, National Library, National Portrait Gallery, both the current Parliament House and the Old Parliament House and the science museum of Questacon. </p>
<p>The other parts of South Canberra don't have as many points of interest, but they are nevertheless still great sights worth visiting. The most notable sight in South Canberra outside Parliamentary Triangle is the Royal Australian Mint.</p>

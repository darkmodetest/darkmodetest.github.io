Purnululu National Park  is a park in the  Kimberley region of Western Australia. This far northeast part of the state is a long way from anywhere: the nearest town is Kununurra 300 km north. Purnululu is sometimes called "the Bungle Bungles" for its distinctive orange-and-grey rock domes, but these are just one locality in a very much larger park.</p>
<p>Purnululu derives from the Djaru Aboriginal term Bullmanlulu for this area. It's best known for the Bungle Bungle hills in the south of the park, the orange- and grey-striped beehive domes up to 250 m tall. The origin of that name is unclear but Billingjal is the Aboriginal name for the hills - it means "sand falling away" which is spot on, their surface is fragile. The north of the park doesn't have beehives but its surface is riven by deep canyons walled by bright sandstone. </p>
<p>About 360 million years ago a river flowed here into a broad plain, losing force and dropping its mineral-laden sand and gravel. In dry years the deposit was exposed to the air and its minerals rusted orange. In wet years a grey bacterial slime coated the deposit and kept out the air. Meanwhile Australia was colliding with tectonic plates to the north - this continues today, throwing up the volcanic ridge of Indonesia and triggering tsunamis. These ructions lifted the whole of Kimberley into a plateau, while the river deposits were compressed under later materials. Similar forces were at play in many parts of the world, creating distinctive red layers of Devonian sandstone. The difference is that elsewhere these are cemented by natural lime, especially from ancient shellfish, making a rock hard enough to use for building masonry. The Purnululu deposits lacked cement and remained loose. When later streams flowed, they quickly cut canyons and left the characteristic banded, beehive-shaped formations. Their surface is so friable that your fingers and boots will erode them, which is why you must stay on the marked trails, and not touch or climb on the rocks. Outlying formations are almost worn away while new ones are being born at the rim of the plateau. </p>
<p>In the Dreaming of the Gija Aboriginal people, ancestral spirit-creatures vied for control of this land and its waterholes; the losers huddle now as the Bungle Bungles. Europeans surveyed the area in the 19th century but were more interested in the land further north, which was ideal for western farming and within reach of a port. These upper catchments of the River Ord were again of interest in the 1950s when an irrigation scheme was conceived, but this too was constructed north downriver at Kununurra and Lake Argyle. It was only from the 1980s that Purnululu got onto the tourist map. It became a national park in 1987 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2003.</p>
<p>Much of the park consists of undulating, deep-red or yellow sandy plains scored by deep gullies, and overgrown with acacia and silver tree bushes, eucalyptus, spinifex and other grasses. Kapok bushes, Kimberley bauhinia, Kimberley heather and Grevillea species mix up the savannah with colour. You drive through 3 hours of this to reach the Visitor Centre, then another 2 hours to reach the Bungle Bungles, then beyond the end of the track it stretches away out to the shimmering horizon. It's a pristine, undeveloped landscape but in this respect not distinctive or unusual. </p>

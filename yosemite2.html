A 1996 slide resulted in 162,000 tons of rock and debris descending to the valley floor near the Happy Isles trailhead, with an impact comparable to a magnitude 2.15 earthquake. Another rockslide, with a volume equivalent to 200 dump truck loads, resulted in several Curry Village cabins being closed in 2008. A 2006 slide buried Highway 140 ft (43 m) in up to 300 ft (91 m) of debris, resulting in a closure that lasted several months and forced the creation of temporary bridges to route traffic to the other side of the Merced River.</p>
<p>Yosemite is best known for its impressive granite cliffs and domes. These formations were born approximately ten million years ago when the Sierra fault began uplifting the Sierra Nevada mountains, forming relatively gentle western slopes and more extreme eastern slopes. Erosion, combined with at least four glacial periods, exposed the underlying granite and resulted in many of the cracked, rounded, and weathered formations that make the park famous. Streams cut deep, narrow valleys, while glaciers covered the area in up to 4,000 ft (1,200 m) of ice and generated wide, U-shaped valleys.</p>
<p>The Tuolumne and Merced rivers are the two major river systems in the park, carving canyons that are 3,000 ft (910 m) to 4,000 ft (1,200 m) deep. In addition, smaller rivers flow through the extreme elevations, generating some of the most impressive waterfalls in the world. In Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls, at 2,425 ft (739 m), is the tallest waterfall in North America, while Ribbon Falls has the highest uninterrupted vertical drop at 1,612 ft (491 m).</p>
<p>95% of Yosemite has been designated as wilderness, making it a haven for wildlife. In addition, over 225,000 acres (91,000 hectares) of the park is old-growth forest, having never been significantly altered by logging. The protected habitat, combined with the wide range of elevations, supports a wide array of animals. Over 400 species of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish live in the park, along with thousands of different plants.</p>
<p>Herbivores in the park include the commonly seen mule deer and golden-mantled ground squirrels, and less commonly seen animals like mountain beavers, pika, yellow-bellied marmots, white-tailed hares, and the rare Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep that are found only around Tioga Pass. Predators include black bears, mountain lions, coyotes, bobcat and gray fox. While once common, bear incidents have declined significantly in past years due to careful management, but be aware that while visitors are unlikely to see a bear, the animals are particularly active at night throughout the park, including in Yosemite Valley, and will seek out food sources that are available to them; heed all park regulations regarding storage of food items or items such as deodorants that have a smell that might interest a bear. Other animals found in the park include 17 species of bats, as well as over 150 species of birds such as great gray owls, spotted owls, white-headed woodpeckers, Steller's jays and northern goshawk. Reptiles are not common but include the mountain kingsnake and Gilbert's skink.</p>

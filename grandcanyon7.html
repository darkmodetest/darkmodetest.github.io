The new Colorado River Management Plan has changed a 12-20 year wait list to a new weighted lottery.</p>
<p>Airplane and helicopter tours are offered by providers outside of the South Rim in Tusayan at the Grand Canyon Airport, and also from Las Vegas. Scenic flights are no longer allowed to fly below the rim within the national park. However, some helicopter flights land on the Havasupai and Hualapai Indian Reservations within Grand Canyon (outside of the park boundaries).</p>
<p>All types of tourist trinkets relating to the Grand Canyon, Native American Indians, and the American Southwest are available in shops in Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim. The South Rim is overflowing with shopping options. The North Rim has only one shop, which is at the North Rim Lodge.</p>
<p>Additional cafeterias are in the Maswik and Yavapai Lodges. There is a grocery deli at Market Plaza inside the grocery store, as well. Just outside the park, in the gateway community of Tusayan, are a number of dining selections.</p>
<p>There are a variety of hotels, lodges, and campgrounds inside and outside of the park on the North and South Rims. As lodging at the Canyon fills early and is fairly expensive, many visitors base themselves just outside of the South Rim in Tusayan. For those willing to stay further from the park the cities of Williams or Flagstaff offer additional options.</p>
<p>The following lodges are inside Grand Canyon National Park. Reservations can be made by contacting Xanterra for the first five lodges, and Delaware North for Yavapai.</p>
<p>There are campgrounds at the North and South Rims. Reservations are highly recommended, especially at the busier South Rim. Outside of the park, Kaibab National Forest has numerous undeveloped campsites and "at large" camping is allowed for up to 14 days. Due to extreme drought conditions, check for closures and camp fire restrictions.</p>
<p>Any camping below the rim in Grand Canyon requires a backcountry permit. Permits must be obtained through the Backcountry Country Office (BCO) at Grand Canyon National Park. Permits are not available online or via telephone. They are only available in person, by fax or by mail. There is limited water available within the canyon, so backpackers should plan on carrying sufficient water with them. All backcountry users are asked to follow "Leave no Trace" principles.</p>
<p>Permits are limited to protect the canyon, and become available on the 1st day of the month, four months prior to the start month. Thus, a backcountry permit for any start date in May becomes available on 1 Jan. Space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground adjacent to Phantom Ranch, generally fill up by the requests received on first date they are opened to reservations. There are a limited number permits reserved for walk-in requests available on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>There are a number of outfitters that provide fully guided backpacking trips (including permits and gear) at Grand Canyon.</p>

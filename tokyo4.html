Hiring a taxi with a top carrier will be better. Top carriers can accommodate up to three large suitcases. Before starting the journey, ensure that the luggage is securely fastened to the carrier.</p>
<p>Generally, the only way to call for a standard taxi is to hail one on the street. This will not be a problem if you are within Old Mumbai or Bandra. It will be difficult to find a taxi in the suburbs as they have been out-competed by the cheaper auto-rickshaws there.</p>
<p>The maximum number of passengers allowed for a trip officially is four — three in the back seat and one in the front. Seat belts are not mandatory for taxi passengers and most standard black and yellow taxis will not even have them installed, though expect them in the branded ones.</p>
<p>Air-conditioned taxis are premium public taxis and its fare is 20% higher than non-air-conditioned taxis. These taxis are really helpful for tourists and travellers who are not accustomed to the heat and pollution of Mumbai. All the rules of non-air-conditioned taxis apply to air-conditioned taxis too.</p>
<p>Since the fare of air-conditioned taxis is at a premium, the common folks usually do not prefer to travel by air-conditioned taxis and is primarily used by tourists or business travellers. For the lack of demand, the lack of supply is also expected. These taxis ply frequently but are not easily available in all locations. You can always expect them to be available at tourist hot spots like railway stations, airports, premium hotels, top tourist spots, etc. If you are not travelling through either of the above locations, and you need the air-conditioned comfort, but do not want to go look for a taxi, it is suggested that you move to the next section.</p>
<p>If you want a comfortable, air-conditioned ride at a small surcharge of 25 per cent over normal taxis it's best to travel by branded cab services that operate at government-approved tariffs. These services operate in modern fleets with well-trained drivers. You can get them at 30–60 minutes' notice, they are clean, air-conditioned, equipped with digital, tamper-proof meters, punctual, honest, and GPS-equipped-monitored, which makes them far secure at any time. If you're using a mobile phone, you receive an SMS with the driver's name, mobile number and car number 30 minutes before the scheduled departure. There is a 25% night surcharge (midnight-5AM). Some can be booked online.</p>
<p>Follow the queue system to board a taxi. Quite frequently, tourists and new visitors are mobbed by unscrupulous taxi drivers. Most drivers are honest, but the dishonest ones tend to cluster around railway stations and airports where they can more easily find suckers. Unless you are taking a prepaid taxi, always ask taxis to go by the meter. At the start of the journey, ensure that the meter is visible and shows the flag-down fare/meter reading.</p>

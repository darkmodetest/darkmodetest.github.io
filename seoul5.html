There are four different kinds of buses: yellow, green, blue, and red. Yellow buses have a short circuit usually around tourist areas. Green buses travel around neighborhoods and connect with the subway. Blue buses go across town, while red buses are intercity buses. Buses will only stop at designated bus stops and will not wait for indecisive travelers. Press the red button to tell the driver to stop at the next stop.</p>
<p>By using a T-Money card, you can transfer between the bus and the subway for free up to 30 minutes after your last scan. That is to say, the base charge won't be charged twice. If, for example, you travel 10 km (6.2 mi) by subway, transfer to a bus and travel a further 5 km (3.1 mi), the fare will be deducted once you leave the subway, nothing will be deducted when you enter a bus, but you will be deducted ₩100 for the extra 5 km (3.1 mi) journey you made on the bus. If you do not tag the machine as you leave the bus, you will be charged the maximum fare possible for the route.</p>
<p>Adult fares as of March 2023 are:</p>
<p>In particular, local buses traveling to Seoul from other provinces (mainly Gyeonggi-do and Incheon) will increase from ₩2,300 to ₩3,000 with a transportation card and from ₩2,400 to ₩3,000 with cash.</p>
<p>South Korea has late-night buses called owl buses. Late night buses are characterized by an N in front of the bus number. The fare is ₩2,500 (cash/card) for adults. See here[dead link] for further info.</p>
<p>Deluxe taxis are black with a yellow sign and are more expensive than regular taxis but provide better and more comfortable service. Regular taxis are silver. For the most part, regular taxi cabs have leather interiors and the drivers are nice—so, for many people, "regular" in Seoul might be "deluxe" in their hometown. It is easy to hail a taxi any time of the day or night along any relatively major Seoul street.</p>
<p>You can call a deluxe taxi wherever you are by calling 3431–5100. Sometimes, you can find a visitor's guide taxi, a kind of deluxe taxi, the drivers of which know English and Japanese and can guide you around Seoul.</p>
<p>As of February 2023, the basic fare for regular taxis is ₩4,800 (₩5,800 at night), with a surcharge of ₩100 applied according to time and distance. (The basic fare is up to 2 km (1.2 mi), plus ₩100 per 132 m.) In deluxe taxis, the basic fare is ₩7000 and the additional fare increases in increments of ₩200. (₩4500 basic fare for up to 3 km (1.9 mi), plus ₩200 per 151 m). International taxi drivers speak at least one foreign language (generally English) fluently.  International taxis use the same basic fare as regular taxis, plus an additional 20%.</p>
<p>The base distance has also been reduced from 2 kilometers to 1.6 kilometers, and late-night surcharges have also increased significantly, from 20% to 40% from 11pm to 2am.</p>

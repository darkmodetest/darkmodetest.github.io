<p>For dinner, many of the inner city suburbs have Japanese restaurants, but in the city itself there is a long an interesting Japanese restaurant history that continues to this day. Both Melbourne's oldest, Kuni's (which has been around since 1978) and its sister restaurant Kenzans are known for a very authentic, if expensive, meal. There are a plethora of choices for those on stricter budgets as well.</p>

Crossways at 123 Swanston St. serves a very popular and inexpensive all-you-can-eat vegetarian lunch, M-Sa.</p>

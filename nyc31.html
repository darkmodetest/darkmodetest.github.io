There are, however, some areas that have changed considerably since 2019 and would invite particular caution. These may not be immediately apparent to those unfamiliar with the city:</p>
<p>If you think you've inadvertently wandered into a dangerous area, hop into a cab, if available, or into the nearest subway station and go elsewhere, and if none of those is an option, don't hesitate to cross the street or duck into an open shop. If a subway platform is deserted, stay within sight of the station agent if possible. Trust your instincts; if a station or street feels unsafe, it's best to leave. In some areas (like the East New York LIRR station) helpful locals may even assist you in finding a safer place to go, or will wait/walk with you!</p>
<p>Airport-style security is common at buildings, museums and tourist attractions, even the Main Branch of the New York Public Library. Generally you can expect to have your bags checked (either manually by a security guard or through an x-ray machine) and walk through a metal detector. Unlike their counterparts at JFK and LaGuardia, security screenings at building entrances are surprisingly quick and efficient - and you can even leave your shoes on!</p>
<p>New York has its share of odd people: talkative pan-handlers, lonely people just wanting a chat, religious preachers, people with psychological disorders, etc. If you prefer not to speak with someone who approaches you for a chat, do what most New Yorkers do: completely ignore them or say "Sorry, gotta go" while continuing to walk at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>Watch out for cyclists and even motorcyclists riding, sometimes at high speeds, on the sidewalk or the wrong way on one-way streets. This has become a constant in some neighborhoods. Also, you will notice that New Yorkers routinely jaywalk, but don't do it yourself unless you have good sight lines and can do so safely.</p>
<p>Despite the stereotypes, many New Yorkers are nice people and don't mind giving out directions (time allowing), so don't be afraid to ask! If you ever get into trouble, approach the nearest police officer. You'll find them to be friendly, polite, and very helpful.</p>
<p>The quality of tap water in New York City is considered to be among the best in the world (unless you are in an old building with outdated plumbing). There is generally no good reason to drink bottled water in preference to New York City tap water. Lower-end restaurants will simply place glasses of ice water on your table (and refill them constantly, for free). At nicer restaurants you will be asked “what kind of water” you want. Asking for tap water is completely acceptable in any restaurant; your other choices are “bottled” (non-carbonated water, such as Fiji or Evian) or “sparkling” (which almost always means Pellegrino).</p>
<p>Being the largest city in the country, New York City is true to its reputation as the "city that never sleeps". Traffic, honking horns, the loud chatter on the streets, musicians busking, and sirens are all undeniable parts of the city's soundscape. </p>

Most attractions are centred around the blocks between North Terrace and Victoria Square on either side of King William Street. The core Rundle Mall shopping district is entirely pedestrianised. The Gouger Street precinct and the Adelaide Central Market are also great destinations for a walking traveller. Travellers keen to keep up on jogging while away can use popular jogging tracks along the River Torrens and through the Parklands.</p>
<p>Adelaide's main important attractions are mostly centred in the City and North Adelaide. Unlike Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane or Perth, Adelaide isn't a place you would want to go to specifically for city life and it's a lot less bustling than the other big cities. Instead, Adelaide is a place where you can enjoy a more laid back pace of life as if you were in the countryside, but with easy access to the usual big city amenities.</p>
<p>Adelaide is known for its churches, and a trip to Adelaide is never complete without visiting one of its churches, not because of any historical or religious significance, but rather for their architecture. If you can only afford time to see one, St. Peter's Cathedral in North Adelaide is one of the most iconic churches in Australia.</p>
<p>Unlike other cities, Adelaide does not have a pass covering all the attractions.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cities, most of Adelaide's parks and gardens surround the city, forming a nice boundary distinguishing it from the rest of Adelaide instead of them being completely in the outskirts. There is also another boundary around North Adelaide as well, bordering the River Torrens making most of Adelaide's parks and gardens concentrated in that small but yet diverse green patch of land in the city. </p>
<p>Most of the other parks and gardens are otherwise found in the outer suburbs, particularly in the southeastern areas of Adelaide, often spacious and have a vast recreational space.</p>
<p>The parks in the city and North Adelaide are an obvious sign that you're in a city, while some like Morialta Conservation Park give a feel that you're out and about in the bush while some like Belair National Park have the perfect smooth transition between urban and rural.</p>
<p>When it comes to national parks, the area of Adelaide only has three national parks, not like Sydney's eleven national parks, which for some would still be considered a lot for a city of its size. The national parks are listed below:</p>
<p>Depending on whether you consider Adelaide Hills to be a part of Adelaide, Cleland National Park was also converted from a conservation park to a national park, which includes several mountain bike and hiking trails and Mt. Lofty, the only place where it ever snows in Adelaide, although that too is very very rare. Nevertheless, it's still a nice park to take a stroll.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Adelaide was named the world's second "National Park City" by the International National Park City Foundation (an organisation to promote national parks) after London which became the first in 2019. It's believed that 95% of Adelaide's residents reside just 400 metres from a park, and over 30% of the city is covered in green space, making Adelaide Australia's greenest city (although almost half of Canberra is taken up in a national park).</p>

It's invariably more expensive than flying, and usually slower than driving yourself, but it is a journey for those who enjoy train travel, or who want to bring their car without the hassle of driving. There are transfers in Adelaide from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. You can bring your car from either Adelaide or Perth. The train line to Darwin was only completed in 2004, and was designed primarily for freight. The terminus for the train is near the deep water port at East Arm, approximately 7 km (4.5 mi) from the city centre; on the other side of Frances Bay, take a taxi, or get your accommodation to arrange a pickup for you. There is no public transport to the train station.</p>
<p>Cruising has increased in popularity in the Northern Territory and the schedules for several international cruises include a day stopover in Darwin. Expedition cruise ships touring the northern coast of Australia are becoming a popular way to visit remote Aboriginal art communities in Arnhem Land and Groote Eylandt.</p>
<p>Cruise ships dock at Fort Hill Wharf, which is quite close the Stokes Hill Wharf by water, but it is a 2 km or so by road.  It is around 1 km (0.6 mi) to the Esplanade, and 2 km (1.2 mi) to downtown.</p>
<p>Driving is the best way to comprehensively see Darwin. Many of the sights are spread out, parking is easy and traffic is usually free flowing.</p>
<p>There is a public bus service Darwinbus, which is useful for accessing areas close to the city. The services are more frequent closer to the central area where the routes overlap, but you will need to plan according to the timetable to get anywhere else - some services only run a couple of times a day. The buses are air-conditioned. $3 per 3 hour transfer or $20 for a weekly pass. Buses can be an opportunity to meet some of the locals.</p>
<p>Walking between attractions or from a bus stop to attractions, even in the inner-city, can be very hot work for those not used to the Darwin climate. Dress to stay cool, and carry water.</p>
<p>Tours are available, and tour coaches are available to some attractions.</p>
<p>Study options in the Northern Territory include VET courses and apprenticeships, as well as undergraduate and post graduate tertiary qualifications. Charles Darwin University is the main tertiary education institution in the Territory, and delivers university and vocational education from several campuses in Darwin and the main towns. See the Territory Government's website for information about studying and working in the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>A working holiday in the Northern Territory gives you the opportunity to experience a lifestyle and culture that's completely different from the rest of Australia.

A new airport is being built in Western Sydney that will begin operations from 2026.</p>
<p>It is around nine hours to drive from Melbourne or from Brisbane. If you're not used to driving long distances on boring roads, you may like to break up the trip over two or more days. Adelaide is around fifteen hours drive; it is usual to allow three days for the drive from Adelaide. The Hume Motorway/Highway between Sydney and Melbourne is a dual-carriageway high-quality road. The same applies for the Brisbane drive as well (except for two 12-km stretches). While it has high-quality sections, it also has two points that stick out like thumbs; Hexham and Coffs Harbour, and also carries high traffic volumes.</p>
<p>If you are renting a car, check the daily distance allowances and any one-way charge that may apply when driving from less popular destinations to major cities. Cars may be rented at the airport and elsewhere from major rental companies, or at smaller, less conveniently located, cheaper companies.</p>
<p>Ride-sharing can be arranged with other travellers. You can find a wide range of carpool offers on the Internet or in hostel noticeboards, etc. Usual warnings apply.</p>
<p>There are tolls applicable to most motorways in Sydney, but there are no toll gates where you can pay. See "Tolls" section below.</p>
<p>Coach companies operate to Sydney from all capital cities, and many New South Wales regional centres. The Sydney coach terminal is adjacent to Sydney Central train station in the City South. Follow the signs.</p>
<p>Coach travel to Sydney is usually quicker, cheaper and more frequent than train travel. Online and advance booking specials are usually available.</p>
<p>Local buses run from the Blue Mountains and Wollongong to Sydneyâ€™s borders. You may have to change buses to continue your journey.</p>
<p>Taking long distance trains from any other major city in Australia to Sydney is not a popular option, with flying or driving often being preferred for being faster and cheaper. Nevertheless Australia does have a functioning, albeit slow, network that may be worth considering if you are not in a hurry or want to get to some remote locations, and taking the NSW TrainLink sleeper services linking Sydney with Melbourne and Brisbane can be cost and time effective, by avoiding an extra hotel stay, and making the most of your days at either end. Unlike the Indian Pacific, these are not luxury trains, but part of the regular state run network, so fares are generally competitive with flying once taxes/fees and getting to and from the airport are factored in.</p>
<p>The New South Wales long distance train service NSW TrainLink Regional, (13 22 32 within Australia) runs at least daily services to Sydney from Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra and many regions of New South Wales including the Mid-North Coast, New England, the Central West and the Southern Highlands. It also services Broken Hill weekly. Travelling time from Melbourne and Brisbane is around 12 hours. Fares range between $50 and $120 for standard class seats and tickets should be purchased in advance either online or by phone. Tickets are only available from larger stations, though it's advisable to book online. The tracks in NSW are often slow and twisty, and generally travel by road is faster, though invariably more stressful, particularly on the Pacific Highway during the summer holidays, when Sydneysiders head up the coast in vast herds of SUVs and caravans.</p>

These leave every evening and allow you to save on a hotel stay at the other end, along with losing no days to travel. Sleeper cabins have two berths in a bunk layout (full bedding in included), and each has a hot shower, sink and toilet (shared between two adjacent cabins), as well as a buffet car with hot meals and a continental breakfast (which can be ordered to your cabin). Food is "no nonsense", affordable and perfectly fine, if not a gastronomic adventure. Regular seating cars are also available on overnight services, but are not recommended if you actually want a good nights sleep and arrive ready for a day of activities. Sleeper berths cost $234 (adult full fare - there are numerous concessions available so check when booking) and need to be booked by phone on 13 22 32 within Australia. Single occupancy is available if you purchase the second bunk.</p>
<p>The Indian Pacific (13 21 47 within Australia or +61 8 8213 4592 internationally) is a luxury train service run by private company Journey Beyond (formerly Great Southern) and runs from Perth to Sydney via Adelaide. Adult fares from Perth start from around $2,100 p.p. during the low season. Children get 20% off when travelling with an adult. Note that Journey Beyond has partnered with the Qantas frequent flyer program, and it's possible to redeem Qantas points for reward seats on Journey Beyond trains. The train departs from Perth on Wednesdays and arrives at Sydney on Saturdays. The train is more expensive than flights from Perth or Adelaide, and takes longer than driving yourself, so this journey is really for rail enthusiasts who want to see the interior of Australia at a leisurely pace while travelling in luxury. See Across Australia by train for more information.</p>
<p>All long distance (NSW TrainLink and Great Southern Railway) trains to Sydney terminate at Sydney's Central Station in the south of the CBD area. Travellers can transfer to Sydney Trains, light rail, city buses, and taxis. It is also easy to transfer to other long distance trains and coaches. There is short term metered parking so you can meet the trains on the platform. There are ATMs, a small choice of food outlets, cafes open until late, and a railway heritage society display and bookshop in the terminal.</p>
<p>The NSW TrainLink Intercity run fairly frequent services throughout the day from close regional areas: Newcastle and the Hunter Valley via the Central Coast, Goulburn via the Southern Highlands, Bomaderry via the Illawarra and Bathurst via the Blue Mountains. Intercity trains do not require a reservation, and the opal card is still valid. On the core routes as far as Lithgow (Blue Mountains line), Newcastle (Central Coast line) and Kiama (South Coast / Illawarra line) run hourly or half hourly late into the night, and start early morning. Fares are very competitive, but onward bus connections from smaller stations are often very poor, especially in the Blue Mountains and parts of the Illawarra. Bikes are accepted on trains (but be considerate, especially around peak times and busy weekends), and can be a good solution to the onward travel problem. Core routes are all operated using double decker electric trains. Travel onto some of the outer lines requires a transfer to a (rather cramped) diesel railcar service. This is true for the Southern Highlands line (change at Campelltown), on the Illawarra/South Coast line for all stops south of Kiama, and for the Hunter Line (change at either Hamilton or Newcastle Interchange). The timetables are usually lined up fairly well to allow for easy interchange. Trains through to Bathurst are extremely irregular (2â€“3 a day), and most journeys require a change at Lithgow to a connecting bus service. Note that there is no catering whatsoever on Intercity services, and that journeys can be up to three hours, even though the distance might seem short on the map, so bring food and drink with you.</p>

When receiving large bills like ¥50 or ¥100, check the paper quality, watermark, and the imprint's clarity to ensure they're genuine. If a bill seems suspect, it's acceptable to refuse it and ask for another. Sometimes, taxi drivers may claim that your genuine bill is fake and discreetly swap it with a counterfeit one. Always keep an eye on your money, especially when handling larger denominations. To minimize your chances of being scammed, use a ride hailing app like DiDi to call a taxi. </p>
<p>There are several "makeshift taxis" running around Beijing including a seat fixed up to the back of an electric scooter. These guys will scam you big time if you don't negotiate a clear fare beforehand. Upon arriving your destination, for a 2-minute ride, the driver will demand ¥300 and will be very belligerent if you don't pay it.</p>
<p>Unofficial cabs hang out around tourist sights like the Great Wall and the Summer Palace. Pirate cabs will charge you a higher fee for the journey, unless you are a good bargainer, know where you are going, and know what the right fare should be.</p>
<p>Driving in Beijing can be quite complicated with seemingly perpetual traffic jams. Many hotels rent cars that come with drivers for up to ¥1,000 per day. Public transport or taxis will get you to most of the main tourist sites and therefore renting a car is not often required at all.</p>
<p>Short visa holders (less than 3 months) can get a provisional driver's license at Beijing Capital International Airport or the transportation police stations in the city within minutes. You need to provide your passport as well as your foreign driver's license and do a small examination to confirm you don't have a physical or visual disability that affects driving. With a provisional license you can legally drive cars in China. Ask any information desk at the airport for directions.</p>
<p>You can find the counters of many car rental companies in the arrival hall of Terminal 2 in Beijing Capital Airport, although English is not usually spoken.</p>
<p>Car rental companies serving the Beijing Capital Airport include:</p>
<p>The daily rate of smaller, economical cars is about ¥200-300. You need to deposit around ¥3000 (possible by using CUP/VISA/MasterCard credit card).</p>
<p>20% of cars have to be off city centre roads on weekdays — you are affected on different days depending on the last digit of your number plate. These alternate every 13 weeks. The police have a right to fine you repeatedly if you are caught on the road when you should have left your car at home. If travelling to Tianjin by car, remember they operate the same system in tandem with Beijing's road rationing schedules. On weekends no such limits apply in either cities, which may give rise to worse jams during peak travel hours.</p>
<p>Vehicles without a licence registered in Beijing are subject to severe restrictions in the capital — most need a special permit to enter the part of town inside the 6th Ring Road, and for those which are granted this licence, it must be renewed nearly every week. You must have your passport / Chinese ID, driving licence and vehicle licence ("blue book", not larger registration certificate) with you at all times, especially when leaving or entering Beijing, as you will be checked by the police.</p>

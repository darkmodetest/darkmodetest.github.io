It can be hotter than you'd expect, colder than you'd expect, drier or wetter. A prepared hiker is better able to survive the extremes of the canyon.  Even for short walks into the canyon keep in mind that it is a seducer: it seems easy hiking down into it but when you come back up you find that you have over-extended yourself.  It's the opposite of climbing up a tall mountain, where you can stop and turn back when you get tired, knowing that the descent will be much easier.</p>
<p>Take water.</p>
<p>Respect the heat, plan for heat.</p>
<p>Check the weather forecast, watch for storms.</p>
<p>Take a paper map with you, and know how to read it. If using maps on your phone, download maps before you go.</p>
<p>Cell phone service is unreliable in the wildness. You may be able to call 911 from some locations, but there is no guarantee. But in an emergency, always try 911: even if you have no service 911 may still connect with another carrier.</p>
<p>Tell a responsible person not in your party where you are going and when you expect to return, so they can alert authorities in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Know your limits.</p>
<p>In particular, do not attempt to hike to the bottom of the canyon and back in one day. Hundreds of hikers each year have to be rescued from the Inner Canyon due to exhaustion and dehydration.  While the temperature on the canyon rim is cool due to its elevation, below the rim it can be very hot.  The vertical distance from the bottom back up to the rim is nearly a mile straight up (1.5 km), in addition to the distance you travel horizontally.  If you plan to go to the bottom of the canyon, spend the night (permit required), and take enough food, water, shelter, and other backcountry camping equipment to keep yourself safe and sound. If you don't have the equipment, don't go.</p>
<p>For an eye-opening look at the dangers of hiking in and around the canyon unprepared, Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon by Thomas M. Myers (long time resident doctor at the South Rim), and Michael P. Ghiglieri (biologist and river guide), describes the various ways in which visitors have lost their lives at the canyon. (ISBN 097009731X).</p>
<p>Don't throw rocks or coins from the rim – these can injure hikers below, and the metal in coins can poison wild animals.</p>

<p>Yosemite National Park is a national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Sierra Nevada mountains in east-central California.  Approximately four million visitors each year come to Yosemite to marvel at its spectacular granite cliffs, towering waterfalls, remote wilderness, massive sequoia trees, and high mountain meadows.</p>
<p>The park encompasses a massive 750,000 acres (300,000 hectares), 1,200 sq mi (3,100 km2) area and contains thousands of lakes and ponds, 1,600 mi (2,600 km) of streams, 800 mi (1,300 km) of hiking trails, and 350 mi (560 km) of roads.</p>
<p>Humans may have first visited Yosemite as long as 8,000 years ago, and there is evidence that people have lived in the area for nearly 4,000 years. In 1849 the lives of the native Miwok population changed dramatically as the California Gold Rush brought thousands of miners into the region, resulting in a massive disruption to the way of life practiced by the existing people.  By the 1930s the population of Native Americans had dwindled to the point that the last Indian village was disbanded, and by 1969 the last private Indian residences (by then solely inhabited by park employees and their families) were abandoned.</p>
<p>The beauty of Yosemite Valley inspired early visitors to the area and led to concern about exploitation by commercial interests.  After prominent individuals advocated for its protection, on June 30, 1864 President Abraham Lincoln signed a bill granting Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias to the State of California as an inalienable public trust. This was the first time in history that the US federal government had set aside scenic lands for the purpose of preservation and public use.  Following further lobbying by the conservationist John Muir, additional restrictions were put in place against grazing in the subalpine meadows surrounding Yosemite Valley, and on October 1, 1890 the area was declared America's third national park. However, as Mackinac River National Park in Michigan became a state park, Yosemite is the second oldest that still holds the "national park" title today.</p>
<p>Despite its national park status, California controlled the initial grant area until 1906.  Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that city began looking to Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley as a source of drinking water and hydroelectric power, and a bitter political struggle ensued between environmentalists and the city. In 1913, with the passage by Congress of the Raker Act, permission was granted to San Francisco to build the O'Shaughnessy Dam, allowing the Tuolumne River to flood the valley. Today, efforts to remove the dam and restore the Hetch Hetchy Valley continue.</p>
<p>Natural forces often wreak havoc on the infrastructure in and around Yosemite. In January 1997 warm winter temperatures, a late-season tropical rainstorm, and a heavy snow pack combined to produce the greatest flooding on record. The Merced River rose nearly ten feet above its normal level, producing over $178 million in damage in Yosemite Valley. As a result the Valley was closed for over three months, and vast changes were made to the area's management plan. Today numerous structures have been relocated, roads have been re-routed out of the flood plain, and nearly fifty percent of campsites have been removed. Signs showing the floodwater height are still posted throughout the Valley.</p>

A list of available families can be obtained from the Government of India tourist office (+91 22 2220 7433) opposite Churchgate  Western .</p>
<p>On the other hand, if money is of no object, you can stay at the Taj in Colaba (the oldest in India), the Leela Kempinski, the ITC Grand Maratha, or the JW Marriott Mumbai, Renaissance Mumbai Hotel & Convention Centre.</p>
<p>The area code for Mumbai is "22" (prefix "+91", if you are calling from outside India). Phone numbers are eight digits long, but on occasion you will find a seven digit number listed. That is probably an old listing. They made the changeover from seven to eight digits a few years back, when they allowed private service providers to offer telephone. Just prefix a "2" to the number and it should work just fine.</p>
<p>Phone booths can be found all over the city. Though they are coin operated, there is usually someone to run the place. (Typically the phones are attached to a roadside shop.) You need to keep putting ₹1 coins into the slot to extend the talk time, so keep a change of ₹1 coins handy with you. The person running the booth will usually have them. If you find a booth marked STD/ISD, you can call internationally or anywhere within the country. Fees will be charged according to the time spent and a meter runs to keep track of your time. You pay when you have finished your call. Often it is difficult to find one that is open early in the morning or late at night.</p>
<p>Cell phone coverage in the city is excellent. There are many service providers offering a wide variety of plans. Among them are The MTNL[dead link], Vodafone Idea (Vi), Airtel, Dolphin[dead link], Reliance Jio, and Tata Indicom[dead link]. It might be a good idea to buy a cell phone and use one of those prepaid plans to get yourself connected while you are in the city.</p>
<p>All mobile numbers are 10 digits long and begin with a "9", "8" or "7". Do not dial the city prefix for mobile numbers. If you don't get through to a mobile number, try adding a "0" before you dial it.</p>
<p>Due to security threats, in order to purchase a SIM card you will need to provide formal identification.</p>
<p>Cybercafes are found on virtually every street corner and the rates are quite low. They have probably not kept pace with advances in hardware or software, also data security could be an issue. As a precaution, change your password after you use it at a cybercafe or do private/incognito browsing.</p>
<p>Finding WiFi will be difficult in many parts of Mumbai, however, nearly all railway stations have been upgraded with 'RailWire' WiFi powered by Google that lets you browse for 45 mins at 5-10 Mbit/s speeds. RailWire WiFi requires you to authenticate with your mobile number and OTP. WiFi is also available at most hotels and restaurants. Airport WiFi is provided by Vodafone Idea.</p>

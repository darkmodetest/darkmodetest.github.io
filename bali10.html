A modern four door 6 to 8 seater Toyota Avanza or Daihatsu Xenia should cost Rp250,000-Rp275,000 per day and a rough Suzuki Katana from Rp90,000 to Rp110,000 per day. Avanza and Xenia Automatic Transmission should add Rp50,000 per day. Cheap, manual 4 seaters like the Toyota Agya or Daihatsu Ayla are Rp150,000-Rp175,000 per day. You will also be given a vehicle identification number (Surat Tanda Nomor Kendaraan) that you can show in case something happens with your vehicle, and if the specifications the renters described matched with the official documents.</p>
<p>Some new surfing areas are only accessible by motorbike, and not all hotels have ample car parking, so you might be tempted to rent a motorcycle or scooter. This can be a frightening yet fascinating experience. Motorcycles are typically 125cc, many with automatic transmissions, and rental tariff is Rp50,000 or above per day (for a week or more, you can bargain for a cheaper price). In areas outside of the tourist enclaves of south Bali, a motorbike is a wonderful way to see the island, but in south Bali, with its crush of traffic, the chances of an accident are greatly increased. Keep in mind that the notion of paradise where everything is quiet and in harmony may not be true on the roads for many cases. Bali is no place to learn to ride a motorbike.</p>
<p>An International Driving Permit (IDP) is required for vehicle rental, with a motorcycle endorsement if renting a motorbike, the IDP must match the licence class of the home country of issue and must be appropriate to the vehicle being used; both documents must be carried. The IDP is seldom requested by the person renting you the vehicle but will be required (along with the vehicle's STNK registration papers). If you're stopped by the police typically a Rp 50,000 "fine" will allow you to keep driving but this strategy will quickly unravel if there is an accident involving damage or injury. Travel insurance will not help you if you ride unlicenced. An IDP is easily obtainable from motoring clubs in your home country. These will cost around US$ 25 as of 2024.</p>
<p>Rental car services owned by individuals or companies are easy to find in Bali and this is the best option for first time visitors. Using a rental car with a driver is certainly cheaper than a taxi and far more efficient than other public transportation. Drivers are usually English speaking, and can usually act as guides, recommending good destinations and restaurants. Renting from a large car company is naturally more expensive than from a private individual; ask hotel staff to recommend a good individually-owned rental car with a knowledgeable driver. Drivers should hold a licence to operate a tourism transport vehicle; if not, you can expect delays and inconvenience if stopped by officials.</p>
<p>Price varies between Rp 300,000â€“600,000 per day (usually defined as 10 hours, but some car rentals are also offered for 5, 6 or 8 hours) depending on your negotiation skills and the class/age of the car. Make sure the price includes petrol and driver for the day. Petrol costs, after the removal of some government subsidies have escalated dramatically (although they still very cheap by international standards) and the distance travelled is a factor if you have not fixed a daily price. Entrance tickets to tourist destinations and any parking fees will be charged to you, and it is good form to buy lunch for your driver. For those on a tight schedule, visiting most of the major tourist destinations in Bali will need about 3 days with a rental car and driver.</p>

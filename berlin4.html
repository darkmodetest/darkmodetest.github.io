The Topographie des Terrors ("Topography of Terror") in central Berlin is an open-air exhibit that gives backgrounds on the sites of various Nazi offices in Berlin and which atrocities were directed from where.</p>
<p>Berlin was divided into four sectors in accordance with the agreements of Yalta and Potsdam. While the powers had planned to jointly administer Berlin and Germany, it broke down with the Soviet blockade of the Western sectors, and then with the Berlin airlift. West Berlin had to be supplied by the western allies through the air.</p>
<p>The airlift, including the dropping of small packets of candy on makeshift parachutes, endeared people in West Berlin to the Western allies, and eventually forced the Soviets to end the blockade. Despite the name "raisin bomber", the single most common good by net tonnage was coal. Because the sectors were cut off from Soviet-occupied electricity lines, the planes also flew in an entire power plant and subsequently the fuel for it, but most coal was used to heat private homes. West Berlin later became a part of West Germany in fact if not in name: it sent non-voting delegates to the Bundestag who were nominated by the Berlin parliament rather than elected by the people; similarly all federal laws had to be approved by the Berlin legislature, which usually happened without any real vote or discussion. Berlin remained the last open crossing in the increasingly militarised and airtight "inner-German" border. On 13 August 1961, the East German (GDR) leadership closed the border just weeks after East German leader Walter Ulbricht said in a press conference "Niemand hat die Absicht eine Mauer zu errichten" (nobody has the intention of building a wall). The border was fortified more and more in the ensuing years with several walls. The concrete wall was soon covered in graffiti on its western side. The side was in East Berlin, but neither the East German nor the West German authorities were willing or able to police it.</p>
<p>While there was an effort in the west to preserve historic buildings which had survived Allied bombardment, the GDR tore down buildings that might have been salvageable. The Stadtschloss was seen as a remnant of feudalism and was replaced with the Palast der Republik which housed the GDR Parliament. It was torn down after 1990 due to its political associations and asbestos content. A new Stadtschloss  at the same site, housing the Humboldt Forum, opened in 2020. The rebuilding of a feudal monument on the site of east Germany's most notable representative building was seen as a dubious political statement, and was controversial because of the questionable way in which many of the exhibits were acquired during the colonial era.</p>
<p>The partition also led to a unique development, especially in the Western half. West Berlin never legally belonged to the Federal Republic of Germany, even though it "voluntarily" applied most West German laws. A prohibition on joining the military made it a place for many students and radicals or people who wanted to avoid the draft to go. The student revolts of 1967/68 mostly took place here. It was here that young Benno Ohnesorg was shot during a protest against the Shah of Iran in 1967. This galvanised a movement against continued presence of Nazi elites, the Vietnam War and several - perceived or real - birth defects of the young German Federal Republic. This movement, retroactively called die 68er (the 68ers), was most prominent in Berlin. Its leader, Rudi Dutschke, an East German emigrant from Brandenburg. In this era, Kreuzberg, a part of which was surrounded by the wall on three sides, became a hotbed of leftist activism. There were frequent clashes with police, which have been occasionally repeated since reunification. During partition, artists like David Bowie came to Berlin for inspiration. A stop at landmarks symbolic of the division became a mainstay of foreign state visits to the city. Ronald Reagan famously stood in front of the Brandenburg Gate, made inaccessible by the Wall, when he said  "Mister Gorbachev open this gate; Mister Gorbachev tear down this wall."</p>

The 210 day wuku or Pawukon calendar is completely out of sync with the Western calendar, meaning that the dates of festivals and events rotate wildly throughout the solar year. The lunar saka (caka) calendar roughly follows the Western year.</p>
<p>All national public holidays in Indonesia are observed in Bali, although Ramadan does not have much of a fanfare here compared to the country's Muslim majority regions.</p>
<p>Bali's unique culture has been widely studied by anthropologists, both professional and amateur. Interested visitors and artists (some of whom made Bali their home) have also written about the island. Here's a reading shortlist:</p>
<p>Daytime temperatures are pleasant, varying between 20–33⁰C (68–93⁰F) year-round. From December to March, the west monsoon can bring heavy showers and high humidity, but days are still often sunny with the rains starting in the late afternoon or evening and passing quickly. From June to September, the humidity is low and it can be quite cool in the evenings. At this time of the year there is hardly any rain in the lowland coastal areas.</p>
<p>Even when it is raining across most of Bali, you can often enjoy sunny, dry days on the Bukit Peninsula which receives far less rain than any other part of the island. On the other hand, in central Bali and in the mountains, you should not be surprised by cloudy skies and showers at any time of the year.</p>
<p>At higher elevations such as Bedugul or Kintamani, it gets distinctly chilly and you will need either a sweater or jacket after the sun sets.</p>
<p>Bali is in the UTC+8 time zone (known in Indonesia as WITA, Waktu Indonesia Tengah), the same as Western Australia, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Philippines, China and Taiwan, and an hour ahead of Jakarta.</p>
<p>Electricity is supplied at 220 V, 50 Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 "Schukostecker" or "Schuko" or the compatible, but non-grounded, CEE-7/16 "Europlug" types.</p>
<p>Some major destinations in Bali have their own tourism offices; contact details are given in the relevant destination articles.</p>
<p>The native language of locals is Balinese, which is related to but not mutually intelligible with Indonesian. Because all Balinese people are bilingual in Balinese and Indonesian, and Indonesian is used more, particularly in daily conversations, learning Balinese is not essential to communicate. Nevertheless, locals are proud of their language, so efforts by visitors to speak Balinese will be warmly received by the locals. In tourist regions, English and some other foreign languages are widely spoken.</p>
<p>Effective February 14, 2024, all international tourists entering Bali need to pay a Rp 150,000 Tourist Levy. Local authorities strongly recommend paying the fee online before arrival in Bali, although cashless payment counters are available at the airport. Payment can be verified by showing the QR code you receive via email after payment. The Balinese government says this fee will help preserve Balinese culture and natural beauty.</p>

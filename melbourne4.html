There are regular flights from all major Australian and New Zealand cities. There are direct flights from many Asian hubs, with connections from Europe, and direct flights from North America, South America and Europe.</p>
<p>The SkyBus service runs regularly to the City, St Kilda, Mornington Peninsula and Western suburbs, costing about $24 one way if you book online, or $40 return. For travellers on a budget, Melbourne Airport can also be accessed by public bus from Broadmeadows station. There is no train link to the airport, but multiple proposals have been put forward for decades. A taxi into the Melbourne CBD will cost around $75-100. There are also Uber ranks outside Terminal 4 and Terminal 2 which will cost between $50-70.</p>
<p>Avalon Airport (AVV IATA) is a mainly domestic airport 55 km south-west of Melbourne in Lara, near Geelong. Although much further than Melbourne Airport, fares from Avalon are sometimes considerably cheaper. The terminals are generally very simple, with just an ATM, car hire desks and baggage carousels. Other facilities include a cafe, bar and a video arcade room. There are several flights in and out of Avalon each day, with flights to Sydney and the Gold Coast operated by Jetstar (which also flies to Melbourne Airport).</p>
<p>SkyBus operates a coach shuttle to Southern Cross Station in Melbourne's City Centre via the outer western suburb of Werribee, meeting every flight arrival and departure. The transfer costs $22 one-way for an adult, and $10 for a child (4–14 years). Other than the coach, there is no public transport; Lara Station is 8 km from the terminal, a taxi to this station costs about $20. A taxi to the city from this airport could cost upwards of $100.</p>
<p>The driving time from Avalon Airport to Melbourne's City Centre is about 45 minutes in good traffic conditions. Avalon Airport is also convenient for visiting Geelong and the Great Ocean Road.</p>
<p>Southern Cross Station is Melbourne's regional rail hub for interstate and intrastate travel. It's on the western side of the City Centre, with good public transport connections to the rest of the city. Train travel in Victoria is very cheap, with the maximum fare for any journey capped at the price of a daily Myki fare ($10.60 on weekdays, $7.20 on weekends and public holidays).</p>
<p>From Sydney, the quickest route to Melbourne is the Hume Highway, which takes 10 hours of driving without any stops. This road is almost all dual-carriageway (freeway). The Princes Highway (National Route 1) goes along the coast and is less crowded and more scenic, but this route takes much longer to reach Melbourne. See Sydney to Melbourne by car for more information.</p>
<p>Adelaide is slightly closer than Sydney and can be reached in 9 hours. The coastal route (again, The Princes Highway) is more scenic but slower. See article Overland travel between Melbourne and Adelaide.</p>
<p>A direct journey from Brisbane takes 21 hours of driving and takes you further inland along the Newell Highway. This makes for an alternative to the standard Brisbane-Sydney-Melbourne coastal route.</p>

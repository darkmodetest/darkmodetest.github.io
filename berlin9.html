Dialect is usually more pronounced in the East and some words are almost entirely unknown even in West Berlin. Some words used in the Berlin dialect:</p>
<p>You may also want to consider flying in to the airports of Hamburg, Frankfurt or Hanover. From there you can take a (high-speed) train or intercity bus to Berlin. The nearby airports of Leipzig and Dresden have fewer scheduled flights.</p>
<p>The airport is in Fare Zone C of the Berlin public transit fare system, so you will have to use a ticket valid in BC (not valid for entering the central "A" zone) or ABC for €4.40 (November 2024). Tickets valid only in AB or the DB "City Ticket" are not valid for travel to the airport and you are subject to a €60 fine (January 2023) if caught using the wrong ticket or no ticket at all. There are also 24-hr tickets and 7 day tickets available.</p>

From Terminal 1: The building that houses Terminal 1 also houses the annex Terminal 2 used by some low-cost carriers and will house Terminals 3 and 4. It is served by 52.36428413.5081572 Berlin Brandenburg Airport railway station.   . As Terminal 1 is served by more airlines and by higher prestige full service carriers, there is a bigger assortment of transportation options. There is a "Flughafen-Express" (FEX) or Airport Express to Berlin Main Station (Hbf) via Ostkreuz and Gesundbrunnen which is the fastest option to the main station from the airport. There are also several long-distance IC lines going to destinations like Dresden or Rostock - they also stop at the main station but cannot be used with an ABC ticket.  After having served the Terminal 5 station,  S9  and  S45  also stop at the terminal 1 station (though they serve one intermediate station in between). Bus X7 also serves Terminal 1.</p>
<p>From the airport by car: Should you wish to drive from the airport, use A113 and follow signposting. Berlin's traffic is becoming a major issue, so think twice before using your car.</p>
<p>The central station 52.5254913.369133NOT EXISTING LISTING IMAGE Hauptbahnhof (Central Station) together with 52.4754913.364744 Südkreuz (Southern Cross, formerly Papestraße) and 52.5100113.434545 Ostbahnhof (Eastern Station) — plus minor 52.5493913.388786 Gesundbrunnen in the north and 52.5347313.198397 Spandau in the west — forms the backbone of all connections. All are connected to S- or U-Bahn. All trains stop at Hauptbahnhof and a second major hub (depending on your itinerary). Regional trains stop at several stations within Berlin, almost all of them also at Hauptbahnhof and all stop at least at one major long-distance hub. The Hauptbahnhof is situated between the S-Bahn stations Friedrichstraße and Bellevue. It is an impressive feat of architecture with many shops, most of them open on Sundays. Given its size, the distances between train platforms are surprisingly short. However, try to avoid tight connections, as the multilevel layout can be confusing at first and Berlin Hauptbahnhof is a good place to kill half an hour at any rate.  The new 'Hauptbahnhof' may appear as 'Lehrter Bahnhof' on older maps.</p>

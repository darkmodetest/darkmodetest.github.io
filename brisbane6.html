You have to pay for the towing to get your car back, and then expect a fine to follow in the mail.  Check for signs and line marking when parking, or just play it safe and find a parking station.</p>
<p>If you are looking to visit the areas surrounding the city, then generally a car will be as quick as any other way of getting around, with the possible exception of the height of peak hour. Brisbane is notorious for having roads that bottle-neck and what would normally be a 15-minute trip could easily turn into well over an hour during peak times.</p>
<p>There are several toll roads in and around Brisbane (clearly signed and marked for approaching motorists), including the Gateway Bridge which crosses the river near the airport, the Clem-7 tunnel and the Go-Between Bridge. Cash is not accepted, toll users must have a prepaid transponder or post-pay via a website. Check the Linkt website for details.</p>
<p>A street directory or GPS unit is an essential addition to your car. Locals are generally friendly and more than willing to help you out if you are lost, so don't be afraid to ask.</p>
<p>Under Queensland law, 50cc scooters can be ridden by just about anyone who holds a car driver's licence. This makes them a good way to get around the CBD, due to limited street parking, and often-expensive off-street parking. Scooter and motorbike parking is free and plentiful. The down side to renting a scooter is that they are speed-limited to 55 km/h. If on a multi-lane road, stay in the left lane. Scooters are not allowed on highways. North of Brisbane you will find many beautiful scenic drives for motorbike enthusiasts. The North side is surrounded by many windy roads and great mountain roads on which any motorbike rider can enjoy a full day out on the motorbike of just about any size. There are services available throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast which deliver both scooters and motorbikes right to your door-step. Some will even provide all the necessary gear as well.</p>
<p>Getting around the city and South Bank is easy thanks to the many cycle paths along the river.</p>
<p>Cycling on footpaths is legal in the Brisbane City Council area (maximum speed 10Â km/h), however pedestrians have right of way. Keep left and take special care when riding through South Bank Parklands as the shared (and quite wide) foot and cycle path is often clogged with large groups taking up the whole path, pedestrians stopping unexpectedly for photos and playing children running heedlessly in front of you. It is often too noisy here to use your bell, so use your common sense, and dismount and push your bike through crowded pedestrian areas.</p>
<p>Maps showing extensive dedicated bikeways and shared paths in the Brisbane City Council area are available on the BCC website[dead link] and a journey planner is available here[dead link]. These bikeways offer a pleasant way to explore and enjoy Brisbane.</p>

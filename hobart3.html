<p>Hobart is perhaps the most car-centric capital city in Australia. The only form of public transport it has is its BRT and its inefficient ferries. There are only two bridges in Hobart crossing the Derwent River (Tasman and Bowen Bridges), and both these bridges can get congested during peak hours. You are best off using a car to get around the city, though it may be much easier to explore the CBD on foot.</p>
<p>Walking is the best way to explore the downtown area.  It is easy to walk between the city centre, Salamanca, and the port/harbour area.  If you are staying in the Salamanca area, you may not need any other form of transport.  Between the City Centre and Sandy Bay via Battery Point is only half an hour to walk (although there are some hills).</p>
<p>Hobart has a sufficient public bus system. The main interchange is in front of the GPO (General Post Office). Ticket prices depend on the distance and start slightly above a dollar.  Services are considerably less frequent on Sundays.  Timetables are all available online from the MetroTas website.</p>
<p>Hobart is hilly any which way you choose to head, so bike riders should be prepared for hills.  There is a poorly developed network of off-road cyclepaths, but Hobart drivers tend to be tolerant of cyclists, and most roads tend to be wide enough to accommodate them.  One old railway line from the city as far as Claremont has been converted to a first-class cycle and walking path (take care from motor vehicles at intersections).</p>
<p>Hobart is the favourite launching off point for visitors keen to explore other areas of Tasmania. A car is certainly the best and most convenient way of getting to the more rural and scenic spots.Â  As most domestic travellers arrive by plane, there are plenty of options for car hires at Hobart Airport.</p>
<p>Roads west of the Derwent River are generally not congested, although you can expect to pay for parking in the city areas. Hobart City Council operates an app that can be used to pay for car parking. Avoid driving in the Salamanca area on a Saturday, due to road closures and traffic snarls due to the markets.</p>
<p>A public ferry operates in the mornings and afternoons from Hobart waterfront to Bellerive pier. Numerous ferries, sightseeing harbour cruises and a water taxi service also operate from the Hobart docks (Brooke St Pier) to outlying attractions including MONA at Berriedale. Some of these include dining on board, while others may terminate at a site with a restaurant such as Peppermint Bay and MONA.</p>
<p>As one of Australia's oldest cities, Hobart is home to a multitude of historical buildings that often showcase splendid examples of Georgian and Victorian architecture. In fact, over 90 buildings within Hobart are classified by the National Trust, with around 60 of them along Macquarie St and Davey St alone. Many, but not all, of the historical buildings are located within or near Hobart's Central Business District (CBD) or around Battery Point.</p>

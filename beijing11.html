The gate closes 5 minutes before departure, so be prompt. You can't book tickets in advance for the S2, so purchase them at the station. Use the Beijing Transportation Card mobile app for other lines.  </p>
<p>The lines are as follows:</p>
<p> BCR S2 :
The S2 line runs from Huangtudian station (near Huoying subway station on lines 8 and 13) to Yanqing. This line is an excellent option for reaching the northern suburbs, particularly during the morning and evening rush hours when the freeways are highly congested. All trains stop at Badaling station, where a free shuttle bus is available to take you to the Badaling Great Wall. Some trains also stop at Nankou station, located between Badaling and Huangtudian. This line is especially scenic during spring, making it a worthwhile choice for visiting the Great Wall. On Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, service extends to Kangzhuang or Shacheng. Fares range from ¥5 for one station to ¥6 for more than one on the main line, and ¥16 from Huangtudian to Kangzhuang or Shacheng. The S2 line is the only suburban railway where you can use a standard Beijing Transportation Card, which should have a minimum balance of ¥16. It is advisable to arrive early to avoid crowds and secure a good seat. Trains can be crowded during the evening rush from the city or the morning rush into the city. The S2 line features a first-class car, a dining car with large windows, and standard class cars.</p>
<p> BCR Sub-Central :
This line runs from Liangxiang railway station (in Fangshan) to Qiaozhuang East railway station (in Tongzhou). All trains stop at Beijing West Railway Station, Beijing Railway Station, and Beijing East Station. While the line has fewer trains, it can be a smart way to travel through the city center, especially during peak hours when roads are busy, and buses and the metro are crowded. The trains are generally less crowded except for the section from Liangxiang to Beijing West.</p>
<p> BCR Huaimi :
The line runs from Beijing North station to Gubeikou in the northeastern suburbs, passing through Huairou town and Changping North station. All trains stop at Changping North Railway Station. However, only two pairs of trains operate to/from Gubeikou per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. An additional four pairs of trains are available between Beijing North and Huairou North. Fares are ¥9 to Huairou North and ¥12 to Gubeikou.</p>
<p> BCR Tongmi :
The Tongmi line starts at Tongzhou West railway station and has two branches. One branch goes to Miyun North railway station, with just one pair of trains: inbound (from Miyun) in the morning and outbound (to Miyun) in the evening. The other branch goes to Huairou North railway station, with one outbound train in the morning and one inbound in the afternoon. Maximum fares for either branch are ¥8.</p>

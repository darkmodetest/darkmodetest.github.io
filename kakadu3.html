Clear skies prevail, the vast expanses of floodwater recede and streams start to run clear. Most plants are fruiting and animals are caring for their young.</p>
<p>Access from Darwin to Jabiru is via the Arnhem Highway.  This is a good road with a speed limit on 130 km/h that is usually open all year round.  Access from the south to Jabiru is via the Kakadu Highway, again usually open all year round.  Check road conditions before setting off.  It is around 3-4 hours drive from Darwin to Jabiru.</p>
<p>You can rent 2WD and 4WD cars in Darwin, with daily distance limits. Campervan rentals often don't have distance limits. A variety of coach and small group tours are also available from Darwin.</p>
<p>During the wet seasons, some parts of the park are not accessible by 2WD vehicles, or even not accessible at all. Check road conditions and closures in advance. This is generally not a problem during the dry season though.</p>
<p>Unlike most national parks, fees are per person, not per vehicle. Fees in Kakadu National Park are also heavily seasonal, with different fees for the dry season, and a slightly lower fee in the wet season. The dry season is from May 15 to October 31 while the wet season is from November 1 to May 14. Passes are valid for seven days.</p>
<p>As of January 2022, the fees are as follows. See the park's website for up-to-date information:</p>

<p>Kakadu is massive (the size of Wales), more than double the size of Yellowstone and larger than all national parks in the US. 4WD vehicles are required to enter some areas. However many spectacular and popular sites are readily accessible via good roads.</p>
<p>Having your own vehicle is the easiest and most pleasurable option. The main tourist route is east from Darwin to Jabiru, then south-west to Cooinda, then continuing on as far as Pine Creek, with a possible deviation south to Katherine, before returning north to Darwin. Such an itinerary could be easily be covered in a few days with longer time if wanting to see things off-road.</p>
<p>Tours inside the park are available with the popular destinations being a day trip to Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls. The pick-up points for these tours are typically from Jabiru and Cooinda.</p>
<p>Scenic flights in either small, fixed-wing aircraft or helicopter are available. Air strips are at Jabiru and Cooinda.</p>

Bininj/Mungguy culture has its own set of social behaviours and customs, which are considered good manners. Please consider these while you are in Kakadu.</p>
<p>Show respect by not entering restricted areas. They may be sacred sites, ceremonial sites, burial grounds or even someone’s home.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Bininj/Mungguy do not greet each other every time they meet. However, most Bininj/Mungguy are used to non-Aboriginal people doing so and may expect a ‘hello’.</p>
<p>Many Bininj/Mungguy do not use personal names as freely as non-Aboriginal people do and often address each other by kinship terms.</p>
<p>Bininj/Mungguy appreciate privacy. It is good manners not to enter living areas and not to take photographs of Bininj/Mungguy without permission.</p>

A lot of tourists and locals alike use services like Uber and Ola Cabs to commute in and around Mumbai. Make sure to read the tariffs in these before you pay. While most of these services do accept cash, a lot of them can also be linked to online wallet (UPI) services like Paytm; as such, overcharging is rarely a risk.</p>
<p>One of the common scams is to charge the night fare rate during the daytime. You should be careful and read the heading before paying. In some cards, the night fare is red in colour and the daytime fare is black in colour.</p>
<p>The night charges are only applicable if you board the vehicle during the night hours (midnight to 5 AM). If you boarded the vehicle before midnight, and your journey is finishing after midnight, you are not liable to pay night charges. Similarly, if you board the vehicle before 5 AM and you finish after 5 AM, you are liable to pay night charges.</p>
<p>Sometimes, auto-rickshaw drivers charge the taxi fare and even show you a tariff card which is used for taxi fare computation.</p>
<p>You can download the m-indicator app which is available in Google Play Store and iTunes App Store. This app carries the latest taxi fares, auto fares, bus services details and local train timetables.</p>
<p>Auto-rickshaws are only allowed to operate beyond Bandra and Sion. They are not issued the licence for Old Mumbai. If you are not used to Indian roads, an auto-rickshaw ride can be heart-stopping, death-defying, laws-of-physics-bending.</p>
<p>Before departing, ensure that the meter is visible and shows the flag-down reading as 1.00 (on a mechanical meter). If the number is higher, insist that the driver flags it down once again. The minimum fare is ₹23 (in 2022). The meter remains at 1.00 for the first 1.6 km (0.99 mi) and every 0.10 movement indicates approx 200 m (i.e. 1.50 for every 0.2 km (0.12 mi)). Every auto driver is supposed to carry a valid RTO-approved meter tariff card. You can check this tariff card before paying. The meter also keeps ticking if you are waiting and/or are stuck in traffic. It's quite handy to have a copy of the meter card issued by The Mumbai Traffic Police. All of this applies to mechanical meters, not digital meters. Newer digital meters have started becoming common from 2012 onwards, and they show the exact fare, so there is no need to convert via the tariff card.</p>
<p>Auto-rickshaws are slower than cars and have terrible suspensions. Pregnant ladies are most strongly advised not to travel by auto-rickshaws since the combination of rash driving, poor suspensions, and horrible road conditions have quite often led to serious complications. The auto-rickshaw is a slow and uncomfortable vehicle and is not recommended for very long distances.</p>
<p>The Mumbai Metropolitan Region around Mumbai is fast developing into a major conurbation. If you need to get to the surrounding cities of Thane, Navi Mumbai or Kalyan, bus services are available.</p>

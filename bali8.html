Construction is tipped to commence late in 2024. Four lines are planned to connect the airport to Canggu, Ubud, Nusa Dua and Sanur. The first stage, connecting Nusa Dua and Canggu, is planned to be operation in 2031. Until then, read about your transport options below.</p>
<p>It should be said at the outset that, as of 2024, tourist-centric public transport does not exist in any meaningful sense in Bali. As you will read below, privately-run buses and minibuses go between various towns, and Denpasar does have a small public bus network. However, for most tourists, taking public buses will not be a convenient way to get around, if it is even viable. This is because taxis are cheap and comfortable, and large buses are more liable to get stuck in the island's horrendous traffic.</p>
<p>The Perama bus company serves the budget traveller well in Bali and beyond, and they have offices in several major tourist destinations on the island. There are other scheduled shuttle buses between many of Bali's most popular destinations too.</p>
<p>A public bus service called Trans Sarbagita is a reliable option if you roam around Denpasar south towards Nusa Dua. TransSarbagita is similar to Jakarta's, but has no dedicated lane. The buses are comfortable and air-conditioned, in contrast with bemos that have been relied upon for commuting. These buses stop only at elevated bus stops on the road curb. All Trans Sarbagita routes operate from 05:00 to 21:00, every 15 minutes though expect that to extend to half an hour due to traffic around Kuta. Though at least 17 routes are planned, only 3 are running as of June 2017 alongside a couple of feeder routes:</p>
<p>Another public bus service is called Trans Metro Dewata with fixed stops - click here for a PDF route map. The fare is Rp4400. An electronic money card is required to take this public transport such as Brizzi, E-money, Flazz, and TapCash. The routes (called Koridor) are:</p>

<p>Kura-Kura Bus is a public shuttle service that operates from southern Bali to Ubud, but oriented towards tourists as it stops at hotels and places of interest. Fares range from Rp20,000 for a single trip around Kuta, Legian, and Seminyak, to Rp80,000 for Ubud. A 3-day or 7-day travel pass would be much more useful if you want to see most of what Bali has to offer.</p>
<p>Due to competition between taxi companies, scams abound with transport in Bali. Tourists could end up paying about 10 times the normal price. The drivers use a taxi with a broken meter and threaten to call the police if passengers don't pay the visible fare. Use BlueBird taxis only!</p>
<p>Metered taxis are very common in southern Bali as far north as Denpasar, but few and far between elsewhere. The starting flag fall charge is Rp5,000 for the first two kilometres and the meter ticks up Rp5,000 per km after that. Waiting time is charged at Rp30,000 per hour. Trips outside southern Bali will incur an extra charge of 30%, as the driver has to go back empty.</p>

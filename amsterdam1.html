<p>Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands. It is known for the canals that cross the city, its impressive architecture, museums and art galleries, its notorious red light district, and more than 1,500 bridges.</p>
<p>The city has earned the title of Venice of the North for a good reason: few other cities have intricate web of canals, exquisite architecture, and a staggering collection of over 1500 bridges weave an undeniable charm. Whether you're here for the rich cultural heritage, the vibrant nightlife, or the serene alleyways, Amsterdam's magnetic pull is universal.</p>
<p>Although once an innocuous and humble fishing village during the late 12th century, Amsterdam catapulted into global prominence during the 17th century as a bustling trading hub. The city's evolution birthed iconic districts like Jordaan and the Canal Belt, the latter earning UNESCO World Heritage status in 2010. The 19th and 20th centuries ushered in expansion, punctuated by modernist districts.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>With a population surpassing 920,000 in 2022 – and soaring well past a million when you account for the immediate surroundings – Amsterdam unquestionably holds the crown as the Netherlands' largest city. Numbers aside, Amsterdam is the financial, cultural, and creative heart of the nation. </p>
<p>The "Amsterdam" that most visitors experience is the city centre, the semi-circle with Centraal Station at its apex. It corresponds to the city as it was around 1850. Five major concentric canals ring the Binnenstad: Singel, Herengracht, Keizersgracht, Prinsengracht and Singelgracht, together forming the Canal District. Other districts inside the city centre are the Jordaan, a former working class area now popular with yuppies, and Plantage, a leafy and spacious area with botanical gardens and the zoo. The Nassaukade, Stadhouderskade and Mauritskade surround the city centre and mark the location of the former city moat and fortifications. Almost everything outside this line was built after 1870.</p>
<p>The semi-circle is on the south side of the IJ, which is often called a river but more exactly is an estuary. Going east from Centraal Station, the railway passes the artificial islands of the redeveloped Eastern Docklands. North of the IJ is mainly housing, although a major dockland redevelopment has started there too.</p>
<p>The river Amstel flows into the city from the south. Originally, it flowed along the line Rokin-Damrak. The dam in the Amstel, which gives the city its name, was located under the present Bijenkorf department store near Dam Square. The original settlement was on the right bank of the Amstel, on the present Warmoesstraat: it is therefore the oldest street in the city. The city has expanded in all directions, except to the northeast of the A10 ring motorway. That area is a protected rural landscape of open fields and small villages considered a part of the Waterland region.</p>
<p>The radius of the semi-circle is about 2 km. All major tourist destinations, and most hotels, are located inside it or just outside it. As a result, a large swathe of Amsterdam is not visited by the average tourist: at least 90% of the population lives outside this area. Most economic activity in Amsterdam—the offices of the financial sector, the port—is near or outside the ring motorway, which is 4–5 km from the centre.</p>

Every year, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras is celebrated on the first weekend in March, drawing people from all over Australia and the world for the celebrations.</p>
<p>Sydney was the centre of the world's attention in September 2000 when the city hosted the Summer Olympics - announced by the IOC Chairman at the closing ceremony to be "the best games ever". The Olympics saw a major building and renovation program take hold of Sydney, positioning it as one of the great world cities of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Sydney enjoys over 300 sunny days each year, and it's a year-round destination. Avoid the hottest days for energetic outside activities.</p>
<p>Sydney's Western Suburbs, which lie away from the coast, tend to be hotter during the day, colder during the night and not receive as much rain. They miss the afternoon sea breezes and the night-time warming effect of the ocean.</p>
<p>Most public buildings like shopping centres are climate controlled inside. Sydney has a fascination with year-round alfresco dining, where you can find yourself dining mid-winter outdoors with a heater a few tables away. Around 90% of public transport has heating and cooling. For the other 10% climate control consists of an open window. Carry water on a hot day.</p>
<p>Sydney climate and weather information is available online at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.</p>
<p>Sydney’s skyline is large and widely recognisable. Sydney also possesses a wide diversity of modern and old architectural styles. They range from the simple Francis Greenway's Georgian buildings to Jorn Utzon’s Expressionist Sydney Opera House. Sydney also has many Victorian buildings, such as the Sydney Town Hall and the Queen Victoria Building. The most architecturally significant structures include the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Skyscrapers in Sydney are also large and modern. The tallest building is the 300-m-tall Sydney Tower, seen rising clearly above the rest of the Sydney skyline and can even be seen from distant Wentworthville.</p>
<p>There are also pockets of architecturally significant housing dotted around Sydney's suburbs. The inner-eastern suburb of Paddington is known for its terrace houses, while several inner-west suburbs contain streets lined with so-called federation houses (built around the time of Australian federation in 1901). A well preserved example of federation houses in Sydney is in the Inner West suburb of Burwood. Appian Way is a circular street built around a lawn tennis courts complete with pavilion house. The large houses are all architecturally unique and built on large expanses of land featuring old trees and lovely gardens. Further away on the lower North Shore, Castlecrag is a unique suburb, being planned by the architect Walter Burley Griffin in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (SYD IATA) is Australia's busiest airport and the main gateway to eastern Australia. It is 9 km from the City centre in Southern Sydney on the northern shores of Botany Bay. Sydney Airport is the oldest continually operated commercial airport anywhere in the world. There are direct flights to Sydney from all the other inhabited continents, as well as some sight-seeing flights over Antarctica. The main ways to get into the city are by train (about $17 one-way on the Airport & East Hills line), or by taxi ($40-50 to the Rocks).</p>

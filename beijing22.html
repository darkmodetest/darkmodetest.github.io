It combines messaging, social media, and mobile payments into one platform. Even regardless of digital payment options, it is highly recommended to install WeChat before arriving in China to facilitate communication.</p>
<p>In Beijing and the rest of mainland China, digital payments are essential for travelers, as Visa and Mastercard are rarely accepted. To ensure smooth transactions, set up WeChat Pay (Weixin Pay) or Alipay before your trip or upon arrival. Both platforms now support linking foreign bank cards like Visa and Mastercard using your home mobile number. If you plan to use a temporary SIM card, wait until you arrive to link your card.</p>
<p>It's advisable to link both WeChat Pay and Alipay, since most vendors accept one or both platforms. Additionally, Alipay+ allows payments via home e-wallets from other Asian countries, supporting apps like AlipayHK (Hong Kong SAR, China), Kaspi.kz (Kazakhstan), MPay (Macao SAR, China), Touch 'n Go eWallet (Malaysia), Hipay (Mongolia), NayaPay (Pakistan), Changi Pay (Singapore), OCBC Digital (Singapore), Kakao Pay, Naver Pay, Toss Pay (South Korea), and TrueMoney (Thailand).</p>
<p>The Beijinger provides an illustrated guide for setting up these services.</p>
<p>As a backup, carry sufficient Chinese currency in cash. Foreign currencies like USD or EUR are of little use, and exchanging them at banks can be time-consuming, sometimes taking up to two hours. However, you can withdraw cash from most ATMs.</p>
<p>The Great Firewall of China blocks popular web services including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Google, WhatsUp, Telegram and many others including Wikipedia. To bypass internet restrictions and access popular websites, travelers often use VPN services. As of September 2024, reports from users consider Mullvad and Astrill to be reliable. Popular VPN choices like Express and Nord are not considered relabile. During significant events, VPN services may experience disruptions. Be sure to install the VPN before arriving in China; attempting to do so after landing can be problematic as the service might already be blocked.</p>
<p>For domestic and international express deliveries, SF Express is the most popular courier service in China. Sending an express mail envelope across the country typically costs Â¥23. For express deliveries to less popular international destinations, DHL Express is recommended due to its extensive global network.</p>
<p>For Muslim worshippers, a visit to the Niujie Mosque in the Xicheng District is highly recommended. As the oldest mosque in Beijing, it is not only a place for prayer but also a cornerstone of the city's Islamic heritage. The surrounding Niujie Street (Ox Street) is the lively heart of Beijing's Muslim community, offering halal dining options and an immersive cultural experience.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Beijing, like all bishops in China, is in communion with the Pope. The Diocese of Beijing is home to several historic churches where Sunday Masses are offered in Chinese, Latin, French, and Italian. You can check the schedule on this website.</p>
<p>For parishioners of the Russian Orthodox Church, the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos Church is the primary place of worship in Beijing. Located within the Russian Embassy in Dongcheng District, it is the only Orthodox parish in the Chinese capital. Regular services are held on Saturdays, Sundays, and feast days. The church also offers a Sunday Catechetic School for English-speaking parishioners, which takes place every Sunday at 12:00 in the church library. Visitors have to plan their visit accordingly.</p>

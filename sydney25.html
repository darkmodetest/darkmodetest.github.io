For most generic pubs, men should wear closed toe shoes (not running sneakers), full-length pants, and a shirt with sleeves (not a singlet). For clubs, men should don neat business-style shoes. In almost all cases, women can dress more freely, but a small number of places require closed shoes or dressy sandals or high heels.</p>
<p>Many pubs are called hotels, but only very few can ever offer you a place to sleep. Hotel pubs are usually found on a street corner with at least one ground-floor bar, and are usually a few floors high (though not all floors may be open to the public).</p>
<p>Entry charges for live music or DJs are usual and range from $5 to $30 depending on client√®le. Entry charges are rare if you're going into a pub for a drink.</p>
<p>There is a taxi shift change at 3AM, and it is notoriously difficult to catch a taxi anywhere between 2:30AM and 3:30AM, but Ubers are out in force at this time of night.</p>
<p>Some types of nightlife are concentrated in particular areas:</p>
<p>There are many great nightclubs in Sydney, but they are very spread out so it would be a good idea to get an idea of where you want to go. Check guides in Friday's newspapers, or the free guides available in music stores and youth clothing stores.</p>
<p>Sydney has hundreds of accommodation options in the central Sydney area to consider, from backpackers hotels to five star hotels with harbour and Opera House views. However, there are options out of the CBD too.</p>
<p>If you are travelling on business, there may be business style accommodation near to where you are working, and there is usually no need to stay in the city. There are options around the commercial areas at the airport in Southern Sydney, around Macquarie Park in the North West, and at Parramatta.</p>
<p>If you are travelling with a car, then finding a place to park, and getting into and out of the city can be a hassle. The Hume Highway in Sydney's South West has the standard roadside motels where you can park by your room, with the service station or fast food outlet next door.</p>
<p>If you are into camping, the closest camping to the CBD is on the Cockatoo Island in the harbour. You can pitch a tent in Lane Cove National Park, less than 10 km from the CBD, around 750m from the train station at North Ryde.</p>
<p>If you are into the beach, Manly and Bondi are the two obvious places to consider. From Manly 25 minutes on the ferry has you right in the centre of Sydney. Some of the lesser known suburbs have accommodation options. Cronulla has beachfront accommodation, facilities and is the only beachside suburb of Sydney with a train station (45 minutes from downtown).</p>
<p>


Sydney has a wide range of backpackers' hostels - popular districts for these include the southern half of the CBD and Haymarket, Glebe and Kings Cross, the Eastern Suburbs (Bondi, Coogee) and the Northern Beaches (Manly).</p>

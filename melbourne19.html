Locations like the intersection of Flinders Street and Elizabeth Street tend to have a higher presence of such individuals. While these areas are generally safe, it is advisable to remain vigilant, as disturbances can occasionally occur.</p>
<p>Protective Services Officers (PSOs) patrol Melbourne's railway stations from 5PM to the last train, with all stations possessing a 'safety zone' with increased lighting, CCTV cameras and easy access to the red emergency button. Trains also contain buttons in the case of an emergency, while it's a good idea to sit close to the driver while on a train, tram or bus late at night. The public transport network is generally safe, although drug or alcohol affected travellers occasionally give other commuters grief. Areas around railway stations tend to be hang-outs for youth gangs in parts of outer Melbourne, particularly at night. Stay in company, and don't engage.</p>
<p>Melbourne has few problems with random crime and violence, although some parts of the are best avoided at night. The city centre, particularly the area around the nightclub and strip club district of King Street, can be a hotspot for alcohol-fuelled violence late at night. Other areas to be cautious around include Chapel Street, and St Kilda, both of which also feature bars and nightclubs. However, you are more likely to be heckled by drunken revellers and street walkers than you are to be actually threatened or randomly attacked. Demonstrating normal safety precautions and sticking to well-lit streets is a good way to avoid trouble.</p>
<p>Some areas of Western and Northern Melbourne have a reputation, generally gained by media reports, of violence. However, if you want to venture out into these areas during the day, there is no exceptional risk.</p>
<p>If driving a car, beware of car theft or break-in. Keep valuables out of sight when parked, always lock the car and leave the windows up before you leave. If you are waiting in your car, lock the car as well. A police officer will always show ID before asking you to open your door or window.</p>
<p>Although scams are rare in Melbourne, there has been an increase in touts at Melbourne Airport who claim to be Uber drivers or offer cheaper fares into the city. To ensure your safety and avoid overcharging, it's best to use the official rideshare apps or taxi services available at designated pickup zones. Announcements are periodically made by the airport warning of such schemes.</p>
<p>If you are a traveler or staying in Melbourne to study who appears to be of Asian descent, you might be approached by young individuals or pairs who seem well-to-do. They may ask you to do a survey or enquire about your faith and where you live before inviting you to a social event. Be cautious, as these individuals may be affiliated with cults operating in multiple Australian cities trying to prey on unsuspecting people.</p>

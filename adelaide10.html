<p>Just like any other capital city, Adelaide has an art gallery, a state museum containing historical artifacts from all over South Australia as well as the border areas neighbouring states, an old gaol (old jail) and most of all, a wine centre in the city. In the suburbs, there's also a railway (railroad) museum, an aviation museum along with many others.</p>
<p>Out of all the museums, exhibitions or galleries in Adelaide, these are some that are particularly important:</p>
<p>There are several other museums, exhibitions and galleries too. See the relevant district articles for information about them.</p>
<p>Adelaide's beaches are mostly in West Adelaide, given the fact that it's the only large district to have a coastline. While Adelaide International Bird Sanctuary National Parkâ€”Winaityinaityi Pangkara also has a long coastline, it's protected and not really a beach for swimming.</p>
<p>If there's anything that's a must at any Adelaide beach, it's surfing at one of the many surf beaches (Glenelg and West Beaches), an Australian classic. Some beaches have surf schools and places where you can rent surfboards, but to a much lesser extent than Sydney. </p>
<p>However, there are some beaches in particular, that get more visitors and are more popular beaches than others:</p>
<p>As every city does, Adelaide also is known for its sport. As with most other Australian cities, Australian rules football (AFL) is the most popular sport, with cricket not far behind. Unlike Queensland or most of New South Wales, rugby league is not popular in Adelaide.</p>
<p>One of the best times of the year to visit is during Mad March, when a multitude of festivals and events are held. These include the Adelaide Fringe, the Clipsal 500 Car race, the Adelaide Festival, WOMADdelaide and the Adelaide Cup horseracing carnival.</p>
<p>Three universities call Adelaide home, of which the University of Adelaide is the best regarded. The other two universities in the Adelaide area are the University of South Australia and Flinders University.  There are opportunities for international students to enrol in these universities, either as degree students, or as part of exchange programs with foreign universities.</p>
<p>Unlike the "big four" Australian cities, top-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada do not have a presence in Adelaide. The Victorian Adelaide Arcade that runs south from Rundle Mall has a fine collection of boutiques and specialist shopping such as numismatics, antiques and chocolatiers. Another good place to look for semi-luxury items would be Burnside Village in the eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>Although Adelaide has many malls and shopping precincts, there are some that are of particular interest to travellers:</p>
<p>When it comes to food markets, Adelaide is never short of them. Some in particular include:</p>
<p>Adelaide's local cuisine generally does not differ much from standard Australian fare, but there are a handful of dishes unique to Adelaide that are worth trying while you're here.</p>

The Ghan runs to Alice Springs and Darwin, the Indian Pacific runs to Perth and Sydney, and The Overland runs to Melbourne. The former two are luxury experiences, and offer sleepers, meals in a dedicated restaurant car, and the opportunity to take your car with you if you are travelling to or from Perth or Darwin. However, they take considerably longer than driving yourself. The Ghan and the Indian Pacific are also generally more expensive than a plane ticket would be, but the Overland is usually cheaper — even the equivalent of a business-class Overland ticket is comparable to an economy-class Adelaide-Melbourne flight on a full-service airline. The Overland stops at a number of rural locations between Adelaide and Melbourne, which may be convenient if your travel itinerary involves some smaller towns. Note that Journey Beyond trains lack Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>These interstate trains depart from the -34.9379138.5813 Adelaide Parklands Terminal just outside of the city. The station can be accessed by car or bus from Richmond Road. Since the demolition of Keswick station, there are no connections to the suburban rail network. Taxis are also available to meet all arrivals.</p>
<p>There are no country rail services in South Australia.</p>
<p>Interstate buses are operated by a number of coach companies including Greyhound, Firefly and V/Line. The journey from Melbourne takes around eleven and a half hours, with both day and overnight services. The trip from Sydney can take up to 24 hours and by definition travels overnight. Fares are less than train and most plane travel, at least on the Adelaide-Melbourne route, although if the timing lines up just right an Adelaide-Sydney budget-airline flight may be cheaper than the bus.</p>
<p>Regional buses to South Australian country cities and towns are also operated by the interstate bus companies, but local South Australian coach companies including LinkSA and Premier Stateliner often provide more frequent services.</p>
<p>Almost all interstate and regional buses depart from the -34.92806138.595874 Adelaide Central Bus Station at 85 Franklin Street in the City. The Central Bus Station operates 5AM-9:30PM, 7 days a week. It has modern amenities as well as a café and it is just across the road from the Adelaide Central Market, a Coles supermarket and Chinatown.</p>
<p>A range of cruise ships call at the -34.7775138.48275 Port Adelaide Passenger Terminal during the cruise boat season, which runs from November to April each year. A list of ships arriving in Adelaide is available from Flinders Ports.</p>
<p>Train, tram and bus services are operated under the Adelaide Metro brand and use a unified ticketing system.
There are three ways to pay your fare:</p>
<p>The peak fare is $4.40 whilst the off-peak fare is $2.50. Each fare allows a travel period of two hours for any distance travelled. There are free trams and buses in the City centre (see below for details).</p>
<p>Accurate public transport directions can be obtained through Google Maps, Apple Maps or the Adelaide Metro website.</p>

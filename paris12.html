It is generally a very bad idea to rent a car to visit Paris. Traffic is very dense during the day, and parking is, on average, exceedingly difficult and expensive. This is especially true in areas surrounding points of interest, since many of these are in areas designed long before automobiles existed. A majority of Parisian households do not own cars, and many people who move to the city find themselves selling their cars within a month or two.</p>
<p>That said, driving may be an option for going to some sights in the suburbs such as Vaux-le-Vicomte castle or the castle and city at Fontainebleau, or for starting to other places in France. You may prefer to rent from a location outside Paris proper.</p>
<p>Traffic rules in Paris are basically the same as elsewhere in France, with the exception of having to yield to incoming traffic on roundabouts. However, driving in dense traffic in Paris and suburbs during commute times, can be especially strenuous. Be prepared for traffic jams, cars changing lanes at short notice, and so on. Another issue is pedestrians, who tend to fearlessly jaywalk more in Paris than in other French cities. Be prepared for pedestrians crossing the street on red, and expect similar adventurous behaviour from cyclists. Remember that even if a pedestrian or cyclist crossed on red, if you hit him, you (in fact, your insurance) will have to bear civil responsibility for the damages, and possibly prosecution for failing to control your vehicle. Note that the speed limit in Paris is 30 km/h in almost every street, besides a few large avenues clearly marked as such. There are no stop signs in the city center.</p>
<p>Paris has several orbital roads. There is a series of boulevards named after Napoleonic-era generals (Boulevard Masséna, Boulevard Ney, and so forth), and collectively referred to as boulevards des Maréchaux. These are normal wide avenues, with traffic lights. Somewhat outside of these is the boulevard périphérique, a controlled-access road with grade separation. The périphérique intérieur is the inner lanes (going clockwise), the périphérique extérieur the outer lanes (going anti-clockwise). Despite the looks, the périphérique is not an autoroute: the speed limit is 70 km/h and, very unusually, incoming traffic has the right of way, at least theoretically (presumably because, otherwise, nobody would be able to enter during rush hour).</p>
<p>Paris is an incredibly open city, with its many "Grands Boulevards" and monuments with large open spaces around make it a city perfect to be explored and viewed by scooter or motorbike. Be warned that scooter/motorbike is by far the mode of transportation with the most casualties in Paris: half of victims of a collision were riding one, although they only account for about 2% of the traffic. When you're riding a scooter or motorbike in Paris, even if you see others doing so, it is not allowed to "lane-split" between the rows of cars waiting in traffic. At the red lights, even though a lot of scooter and motorbike drivers do not respect it, don't forget to pay attention to the bike designated area: you are not allowed to use them, and doing so is equivalent to failing to respect the red light (€135 fine). Parking-wise there are plenty of deux roues (two wheel) parking spots all over the city. Again, even though you may see plenty of scooters or motorbikes parked on the sidewalk, it is forbidden to do so. The city of Paris has dramatically increased the number of vehicles fined every day (€35), some of them even being towed away (at your own expenses).</p>

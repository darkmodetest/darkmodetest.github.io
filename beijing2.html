Despite the changing political climate, Beijing remained the capital. The Manchu imperial family moved into the Forbidden City and remained there until 1911. The Qing built both the Summer Palace and Old Summer Palace. These served as summer retreats for the emperors and their entourages. During the 19th century, Western countries established foreign legations in the Qianmen area south of the Forbidden City. These came under siege during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.</p>
<p>The Qing dynasty fell in 1911 and was replaced by the Republic of China, with Sun Yat-sen as its first president. In the chaotic first years of Republican China, Beijing was beset by fighting warlords. Following the Northern Expedition, the Kuomintang moved the capital to Nanjing in 1928, and renamed Beijing as Beiping (北平, literally "Northern Peace") to emphasize that it was no longer the capital. Beijing remained a center for education and culture throughout the Republican Era. The Kuomintang lost the city to the Communists in January 1949. After 6 months, the new government proclaimed a People's Republic with its capital at Beijing.</p>
<p>After over 20 years of isolation from Western countries, the visit of US President Richard Nixon in 1972 marked a significant turning point for China. Following this visit, Beijing experienced a spurt of international visitors, leading to the addition of Block D to the historic Beijing Hotel in 1974. By the end of 1978, the era of reform and opening-up had begun, transforming the city into a thriving economic hub. In the early 1980s, Beijing welcomed hundreds of thousands of foreign tourists annually, prompting the construction of the 1,000-room luxury Great Wall Hotel, completed in 1983-84, to accommodate the growing influx.</p>
<p>The 1980s introduced new modes of thought and lifestyle, with the emergence of supermarkets, fast food outlets, high-rise apartments and offices, as well as numerous luxury hotels. By the 2000s, Beijing had transformed into a global city with a stunning skyline of contemporary architectural wonders, further highlighted by its hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Notably, Beijing remains the only city in the world to have hosted both the Summer Olympics (in 2008) and the Winter Olympics (in 2022).</p>
<p>In the post-pandemic era, China has shifted its focus from Western countries to strengthening relationships with the Global South. However, effort is still made to attract European tourism, introducing short-term visa-free policies in 2024 for several European and Southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>Beijing is one of China's four municipalities (直辖市), cities that are not part of any province, and whose governments instead report directly to the central government. It is a vast city spanning 16,800 km² and divided into 16 districts, with significant distances between them. The city is bordered by Hebei province to the north, west, and south, and by Tianjin to the east. Beijing is a central part of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) regional development strategy, launched in 2014, which aims to create a mega region with enhanced connectivity. High-speed rail now allows travelers to reach Tianjin from Beijing in just 30 minutes, and the newly developed Xiong'an New Area in Hebei in 20 minutes. Xiong'an is envisioned as a techno and eco-utopia, designed to relieve some of Beijing's non-capital functions, though only time will prove whether Xiong'an will prosper or not.</p>

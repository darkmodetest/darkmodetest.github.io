The Giardia parasite, which can cause a nasty and persistent gastrointestinal disturbance, is common in the water here. There is potable water available at the visitor center, museum, Grotto, and the campgrounds in the park.</p>
<p>There is only one lodge within the park. The towns of Springdale and Mount Carmel Junction are located just outside of the park and have numerous places to stay, as do further afield towns such as Hurricane and Apple Valley.</p>
<p>As  free dispersed camping is permitted on Bureau of Land Management land, it's trivial to camp for free right outside the border of Zion. For example, Kolob Terrace Road--which is about 30km from Springdale just outside the park--has plenty of spots on BLM land. Just drive down that road and pay attention to the "now entering Zion" and "now leaving Zion" signs. The bits between the "leaving" and "entering" are mostly BLM land. There are many pull-offs on BLM land on this road where you can camp for free. As this road goes in-and-out of the park, there's also many trailheads along it.</p>
<p>All backcountry camping requires a permit, which is available for a fee at the visitor center. Maximum group size for backcountry usage is twelve people.</p>
<p>Walk-in permits are issued the day before a canyoneering trip. Backpacking permits are issued up to three days prior to the trip date. Permits given out are limited and issued only when the backcountry desk at the visitor center is open. Express Permits allow participants to obtain a permit on-line.  Sign-up every three years is required and must be in person and at the backcountry desk. Due to the popularity of the "Subway" and Mystery Canyon, a lottery has been setup to dole out permits for these two technical slot canyons.</p>
<p>Reservations can be revoked in the event of adverse environmental conditions such as flash flood danger. Hikers are required to obtain a permit in person at the backcountry desk the day before or day of a hike.</p>
<p>Pristine Zones allow up to 12 people, and hiking/canyoneering in these zones usually requires technical gear and equipment: Mystery Canyon, Imlay Canyon, Kolob Canyon, Behunin Canyon, Heaps Canyon, Echo Canyon, Spry Canyon, Englstead Hollow, Bulloch Canyon, Ice Box, and the Upper Right Fork of North Creek.</p>
<p>Primitive Zones allow up to 50 visitors: Orderville Canyon, Pine Creek Canyon, Keyhole Canyon, and the Subway.</p>
<p>Weather conditions are posted at the visitor center, but flash floods can occur in the park without warning. The danger is not limited to just hiking in slot canyons. People have been washed off trails to their deaths during flash floods. Although it's gorgeous when the rain pours, it's not a safe time to be on the trails. Flood waters originate upstream, so a flood may occur when the weather does not seem bad overhead. If hiking in a narrow canyon and the water begins to rise even slightly or get muddy, begin looking for higher ground. The Virgin River water contains a toxic level of cyanobacteria, so do not drink it.</p>

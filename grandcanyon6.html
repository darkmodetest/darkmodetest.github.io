Tribal headquarters are in the impoverished town of Peach Springs. The Grand Canyon Resort Corporation is a collection of tourist enterprises wholly owned by the tribe. Activities include motorized rafting trips on last few miles of white water in the canyon, and pontoon boat rides on the smooth waters of Lake Mead. Grand Canyon West (in the remote northwest corner of the reservation) is a collection of viewpoints overlooking the last few miles of Grand Canyon and the stagnant waters of the Colorado River as it flows into Lake Mead. The Hualapai have partnered with dozens of commercial tour operators from the Las Vegas area, and a tour package purchase (ranging from $29–109 per person) is required for entry to the Grand Canyon West area. Helicopter flights are available from Las Vegas to the canyon rim. Extra cost options include the Skywalk, and a helicopter flight to the bottom of the canyon, next to the Colorado River.</p>
<p>Hiking in the Grand Canyon is unlike anywhere else on Earth: trails range in difficulty from 15-minute loops to multi-week treks, and all offer spectacular views. In addition, there are numerous unmaintained trails throughout the park for the more adventurous. For people who prefer guided hikes a variety of outfitters offer options. While most canyon hikes entail significant elevation change, less-strenuous hiking options include nature walks along the rim trail which offer great views without requiring much exertion.</p>
<p>Take water.</p>
<p>Respect the heat.</p>
<p>Watch for storms.</p>
<p>Know your limits.</p>
<p>All hikers should take trail warnings extremely seriously. Temperatures in the canyon may vary by 50–70°F depending on elevation and time of day, and unlike most places, the most challenging portion of a hike in the Grand Canyon will always be the end, meaning that if you run out of water you will get heat stroke, and if you get too tired you will be unable to get back to the trailhead. Carry more liquid than you think you'll need, and know your limits. It is far too easy to overextend yourself hiking in the canyon, and each year over 250 people require rescue due to underestimating the heat and difficulty. Also be aware that trails may be icy during the winter – if you have crampons for your shoes or hiking poles you should bring them or consider purchasing them from a local shop.</p>
<p>From the south side it is possible to do a loop going down the South Kaibab Trail and up the Bright Angel Trail. You can leave a vehicle at the Bright Angel Trail head and take public transit to the South Kaibab Trail head. While often not recommended as a day hike, if you are fit it can be done in between 6 and 10 hours.</p>
<p>Whitewater rafting expeditions depart daily during the summer months from Lees Ferry. Commercial trips range from 3–18 days and cover from 87–300 miles (140–483 km). Trips book up fast so be sure to book your trip about a year in advance or you will have to get lucky with cancellations.  The most popular section of river for the "true" Grand Canyon river experience lies between Lees Ferry and Diamond Creek.</p>

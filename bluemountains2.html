The passes provide faster entry and are valid for 12/24 months from date of purchase. The fees per vehicle (as at 2022) are as follows:</p>
<p>There is also a fourth pass; the Single Park Pass, worth $22 for one year and $40 for two. Note that having an NSW Parks pass does not give you free parking at Katoomba, as the parking lot is outside the park.</p>
<p>The Main Western Line has frequent trains that run from Penrith to Lithgow and Bathurst, with stops at various towns in the Blue Mountains. Bushwalking tracks are within short walking distance from the Katoomba, Leura, Blackheath, Lithgow, Wentworth Falls, Woodford, Glenbrook, and other train stops along the Main Western Line.</p>
<p>When bushwalking, try not to miss the beautiful flora (plants) and fauna (animals). You will find a lovely and colourful range of flowers. If you ever come across animals, you should never do anything to hurt them, as they will not like to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when going bushwalking is that you make sure you don't step on any animals' homes and you should never make new trails and cause erosion.</p>
<p>The Blue Mountains National Park has many interesting things to do.</p>
<p>This is a very popular pastime in the Blue Mountains and there are a number of well-maintained trails that will offer you the opportunity to go down into the valley floor, viewing the changing vegetation as you descend. Lyrebirds can be found in the undergrowth in the valley. They imitate the sounds of other birds, so you will probably need to keep your eyes open for them but they are quite a find for any bushwalker to come across. With many things to do, and many places to explore, why wouldn't you try it some time.</p>
<p>There are a number of amazing sites to see just from the main highway and major roads.  The Three Sisters is one famous site that every visitor to the Blue Mountains must stop and see.  There are fabulous views from many vantage points and it is evident on a clear day why the Mountains received their name of "Blue", as the Eucalyptus shimmer in the distance, creating a hazy blue as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p>At Lithgow, you will come across the famous Zig-Zag Railway. This train is a switchback form and was built in the 19th century as a tourist attraction, which it remains today.  At the time it was built, it was a major engineering feat.</p>
<p>The only sort of shop is at the discovery centre (see #See) or at Echo Point Visitor Centre. Otherwise, you there's plenty of shops in the towns that make up the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>There is only a single place to eat in the entire park area, but that should be no surprise given how the park is just a vast wilderness. However, a few metres outside the park and there's plenty of choices to choose from. See the Katoomba, Blackheath and all the other cities listed in Blue Mountains.</p>
